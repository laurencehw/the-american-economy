# Construction Industry Sources (Chapter 13)

**Compiled via Gemini Ultra, January 2026**

## 1. The Syverson & Goolsbee Paper (KEY SOURCE)

**Citation:** Goolsbee, A., & Syverson, C. (2023). *The Strange and Awful Path of Productivity in the U.S. Construction Sector*. NBER Working Paper No. 30845.

**Key Findings:**
- **The "Productivity Puzzle":** Construction productivity has fallen or stagnated since ~1970, unique among major U.S. industries
- **Measurement Error is Not the Cause:** They reject the hypothesis that the decline is a statistical mirage
- **The "Value-Added" Shift:** Industry has shifted toward more intermediate inputs relative to labor, yet efficiency has dropped
- **Regional Misallocation:** Construction activity has not reallocated to high-productivity regions, suggesting regulatory frictions

### A. Productivity Stagnation
- **D'Amico, L., Glaeser, E. L., Gyourko, J., Kerr, W. R., & Ponzetto, G. A. (2024).** *Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation*. NBER Working Paper No. 33188.
  - Land-use regulations limit project size, preventing economies of scale
  - Estimate: if homebuilding firms had manufacturing's size distribution, productivity could be **60% higher**

### B. Housing Supply Elasticity & Regulation
- **Glaeser, E. L., & Gyourko, J. (2018).** *The Economic Implications of Housing Supply*. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 32(1), 3-30.
  - Definitive overview of how local land-use restrictions make housing supply inelastic

- **Hsieh, C. T., & Moretti, E. (2019).** *Housing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation*. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics.
  - Housing restrictions in high-productivity cities lowered aggregate US growth by up to 36% (1964-2009)

### C. Construction Labor Markets
- **Allen, S. G. (1985).** *Why Construction Industry Productivity is Declining*. NBER Working Paper No. 1555.
  - Foundational paper: shift from large-scale commercial to smaller residential work contributed to "de-skilling"

### D. Modular/Prefab Economics
- **Bertram, N., et al. (2019).** *Modular construction: From projects to products*. McKinsey & Company.
  - Off-site construction can speed up construction by **50%** and reduce costs by **20%**
  - Faces barriers in financing and supply chain maturity

## 3. Industry Data

### Size & Economic Contribution
- **GDP:** ~$1.3 Trillion (approx. 4.5% of US GDP)
- **Gross Output:** ~$2.2 Trillion annually (2024 est)
- **Employment:** ~8.3 Million workers

### Market Structure
- **General Contracting:** Highly fragmented (~800,000 firms, most <10 employees)
- **Homebuilding:** Concentrating — top 10 builders now control **~45%** of new home market (up from ~27% two decades ago)

### Major Firms (ENR Top 400)
| Segment | Key Players |
|---------|-------------|
| Engineering/Heavy Civil | Bechtel, Fluor, Kiewit |
| Commercial/General | Turner Construction, Whiting-Turner |
| Homebuilders | D.R. Horton (#1), Lennar, PulteGroup |
| International Giants | VINCI (France), Grupo ACS (Spain) |

### Workforce Characteristics
- **Unionization:** 10.3% (2024) — strong regional variance (high in Northeast/Midwest urban, low in Sunbelt residential)
- **Immigrant Labor:** ~30% of workforce; >50% in trades like drywall, roofing in TX/CA
- **Demographics:** Aging crisis — for every 4 workers retiring, only 1 enters

## 4. Recent Trends (2024-2025)

### A. Manufacturing Supercycle (Reshoring)
- Construction spending on manufacturing facilities has **tripled** since 2021
- Drivers: CHIPS Act (semiconductor fabs), IRA (battery plants/EVs)
- Source: Census Bureau Construction Spending Data

### B. Infrastructure Investment (IIJA)
- Public works spending growing at double-digit rates as $1.2T federal funds hit pipeline
- Creating competition for heavy civil labor and materials

### C. Cost Volatility
- Lumber stabilized post-COVID
- Concrete and electrical switchgear remain expensive/scarce (data centers, infrastructure demand)
- "Time to build" has increased significantly

### D. Geographic Shift
- Activity heavily skewed toward South and West (TX, FL, AZ, TN)
- Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston: top markets for housing starts and industrial warehouse construction
