# 3. The Geography of Production

Economic activity is not spread evenly across the American landscape. Half of U.S. GDP comes from just five states---California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois. The New York metropolitan area alone produces more than all but a handful of countries. Meanwhile, vast stretches of rural America have seen population and employment decline for decades.

This geographic concentration matters enormously for policy, politics, and individual opportunity. Where you live shapes what jobs are available, what you'll earn, and what kind of life you can build. Understanding the spatial economy is essential to understanding America.

## The State-Level Picture

### Economic Giants

| State | GDP (2023) | Share of U.S. | Population |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| California | $3.25 trillion | 12% | 39 million |
| Texas | $2.10 trillion | 8% | 30 million |
| New York | $1.79 trillion | 7% | 19 million |
| Florida | $1.29 trillion | 5% | 22 million |
| Illinois | $886 billion | 3% | 12 million |

California's economy exceeds that of India or the United Kingdom. It would rank among the world's five largest countries. Texas has grown rapidly, riding oil production and business-friendly policies to become America's second-largest economy. New York punches above its population weight, reflecting the concentration of finance, media, and professional services in Manhattan.

### The Productivity Divide

GDP per capita varies enormously across states:

**Highest:**
- Washington, D.C.: roughly $260,000 (distorted by small population and federal concentration)
- New York: $111,000
- Massachusetts: $105,000
- Washington State: $95,000
- California: $83,000

**Lowest:**
- Mississippi: roughly $30,000
- West Virginia: roughly $32,000
- Arkansas: roughly $35,000
- Alabama: roughly $37,000
- New Mexico: roughly $38,000

The gap is striking: a worker in Massachusetts produces (on average) three times as much value as a worker in Mississippi. This reflects differences in industry mix, educational attainment, capital investment, and agglomeration effects.

### Regional Patterns

Broad regions show distinct economic characters:

**The Northeast** (New England plus Mid-Atlantic): High productivity, high costs, concentrated in finance, healthcare, education, and professional services. Population growth has stagnated but economic output remains strong.

**The Southeast**: Rapid growth, driven by migration from the Northeast and Midwest. Mix of legacy industries (auto transplants, textiles remnants) and new growth (logistics, tech outposts). Lower wages but lower costs.

**The Midwest**: The old manufacturing heartland, now more diversified. Agriculture remains important. Major metros (Chicago, Minneapolis, Columbus) thrive while small cities struggle.

**The Southwest**: Texas and Arizona drive growth, fueled by energy, migration, and business relocation. Water constraints loom as a long-term challenge.

**The West Coast**: Technology dominance in California and Washington. High productivity, high costs, severe housing constraints. Oregon combines tech (Portland) with resource industries.

**The Mountain West**: Low population density, resource extraction (mining, energy), tourism, and increasingly remote workers fleeing coastal costs. Colorado and Utah have diversified; Wyoming and Montana remain resource-dependent.

## Metropolitan Dominance

### The Metro Economy

Economic activity concentrates in metropolitan areas---urban cores plus surrounding suburbs. About 85% of U.S. GDP comes from the 384 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), even though they cover only about 3% of land area.

The concentration is even more extreme at the top:

| Metro Area | GDP (2023) | Notable Industries |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| New York-Newark | $2.3 trillion | Finance, media, professional services |
| Los Angeles | $1.3 trillion | Entertainment, trade, aerospace |
| Chicago | $895 billion | Finance, manufacturing, logistics |
| San Francisco | $779 billion | Technology, biotech, finance |
| Dallas-Fort Worth | $745 billion | Corporate HQs, telecom, defense |
| Washington, D.C. | $715 billion | Government, defense, professional services |
| Houston | $697 billion | Energy, healthcare, petrochemicals |
| Boston | $610 billion | Healthcare, biotech, education, finance |

The top eight metros produce nearly $8 trillion---about 30% of GDP. Add the next dozen, and you've accounted for half the economy.

### Why Cities?

Why does economic activity cluster so intensely? Economists point to **agglomeration economies**---the benefits firms and workers gain from proximity:

**Knowledge spillovers**: Ideas spread faster when people interact. Silicon Valley engineers learn from each other across company lines. Wall Street traders share market intelligence. Academic researchers collaborate across institutions. These informal knowledge flows are hard to replicate at a distance.

**Labor market pooling**: Dense metros offer deep labor pools for specialized skills. A software company in San Francisco can find machine learning engineers; in rural Nebraska, it cannot. Workers benefit too---if one employer fails, others are nearby.

**Input sharing**: Specialized suppliers locate near customers. A biotech company in Boston can access contract manufacturers, specialty chemicals, regulatory consultants, and patent lawyers all nearby. In isolation, it would need to do everything in-house or ship inputs from far away.

**Matching**: Cities facilitate better matches between workers and jobs, between firms and suppliers, between ideas and capital. The friction of search declines when options are concentrated.

### The Superstar City Phenomenon

Some metros have pulled away from the pack. Economists Enrico Moretti, Chang-Tai Hsieh, and others have documented growing divergence among cities:

- In 1980, wages in San Francisco were about 20% above the national average. By 2020, the gap exceeded 50%.
- Productivity growth has concentrated in a handful of metros; most others have stagnated.
- The pattern is particularly stark in innovation: a few metros (San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Boston) account for most patents and venture capital investment.

This concentration creates both opportunity and tension. Workers in superstar cities earn high wages but face crushing housing costs. Workers elsewhere enjoy affordability but limited job options. The divergence fuels political polarization between thriving metros and struggling hinterlands.

## Industry Location Patterns

### Measuring Specialization: Location Quotients

Economists measure geographic specialization using **location quotients (LQ)**. If an industry's share of employment in a region exceeds its national share, the region is specialized in that industry.

$$
LQ = \frac{\text{Industry share in region}}{\text{Industry share in nation}}
$$

An LQ of 1.0 means the region matches the national average. An LQ of 2.0 means the industry is twice as concentrated locally as nationally.

Examples:
- **Finance in New York**: LQ ≈ 2.5 (Wall Street concentration)
- **Entertainment in Los Angeles**: LQ ≈ 3.0 (Hollywood dominance)
- **Auto manufacturing in Michigan**: LQ ≈ 4.0 (Detroit's legacy)
- **Oil and gas in Houston**: LQ ≈ 8.0 (extreme concentration)

### Where Industries Cluster

Different industries have different geographic logic:

**Resource-bound industries** locate near natural endowments:
- Oil and gas: Permian Basin (TX/NM), Gulf Coast, Bakken (ND), Appalachia
- Mining: Nevada (gold), Arizona (copper), Wyoming (coal), Minnesota (iron ore)
- Agriculture: Great Plains (wheat), Midwest (corn/soybeans), California (fruits/vegetables)

**Market-oriented industries** locate near customers:
- Retail: distributed roughly proportional to population
- Hospitals: located in population centers
- Construction: follows population and investment

**Transport-oriented industries** locate at logistics nodes:
- Ports: Los Angeles/Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Houston, Savannah
- Distribution centers: Inland Empire (CA), Memphis, Dallas, Chicago
- Refineries: Gulf Coast (near both oil supply and shipping)

**Knowledge-intensive industries** cluster for agglomeration benefits:
- Tech: Silicon Valley, Seattle, Austin, Boston
- Finance: New York, Chicago, Charlotte
- Biotech: Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego
- Entertainment: Los Angeles, New York

### Industry Clusters

Clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected industries, suppliers, and institutions. Famous examples:

**Silicon Valley** (tech): The original and still dominant tech cluster. Stanford and Berkeley provide research and talent. Venture capital is concentrated nearby. A dense network of suppliers, service providers, and former colleagues enables rapid company formation and scaling.

**Wall Street** (finance): Lower Manhattan houses the New York Stock Exchange, major banks, hedge funds, and the infrastructure of American finance. Proximity to capital and to each other creates information advantages that resist dispersal despite modern communications.

**Detroit** (auto): Despite decades of decline, the Detroit area retains the densest concentration of automotive engineering talent, suppliers, and expertise. The Big Three maintain headquarters there; even foreign automakers locate design and engineering centers nearby.

**Houston** (energy): The headquarters of most major oil companies, plus the service companies, engineering firms, and legal practices that support them. When oil prices move, Houston's economy responds immediately.

**Research Triangle** (NC): A deliberate creation of three universities (Duke, UNC, NC State) plus corporate research parks. Biotech, pharma, and tech have built critical mass over decades.

## Urban vs. Rural

### The Rural Economy

Rural America---roughly 20% of the population spread across 97% of the land---faces persistent economic challenges:

**Population decline**: Most rural counties have lost population since 2010. Young people leave for education and opportunity; few return.

**Job losses**: Agriculture employs fewer workers each year as technology substitutes for labor. Manufacturing has declined. Mining booms and busts.

**Lower productivity**: Rural workers earn about 70% of urban wages on average. The gap has widened over time.

**Service deserts**: As population thins, services consolidate. Hospitals close. Schools consolidate. Main streets empty.

<figure>

<figcaption>Figure 3.4: The urban-rural divide in employment. Urban areas have diversified economies; rural areas depend more heavily on agriculture, mining, and government. Source: BLS (2023)</figcaption>
</figure>

Yet rural America is not monolithic:

**Resource-rich rural areas** (Permian Basin oil country, Bakken shale, productive farmland) can be prosperous, at least while resources last.

**Recreational rural areas** (mountain towns, beach communities, national park gateways) attract retirees and tourists, supporting service economies.

**Commuter rural areas** within reach of metros function as exurbs, with residents earning urban wages while enjoying rural amenities.

**Declining rural areas** far from metros and without distinctive resources face the toughest challenges. These are the places losing population, closing stores, and aging rapidly.

### The Remote Work Shift

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated remote work adoption, potentially reshaping economic geography. If workers can do their jobs from anywhere, will they leave expensive metros for affordable rural areas or smaller cities?

Evidence so far is mixed:

- Some outmigration from expensive metros (San Francisco, New York) occurred, but population flows were modest compared to the hype.
- Mid-size cities and suburbs gained more than truly rural areas.
- Employers have increasingly called workers back to offices, limiting permanent dispersal.
- Industries most suited to remote work (tech, finance, professional services) were already concentrated in metros.

The long-term impact remains uncertain. Remote work has loosened but not severed the link between productive jobs and major metros.

## The Cost of Geography

### Housing Constraints

Housing costs mediate the relationship between productive places and opportunity. Workers would like to move to high-wage metros, but housing costs eat their wage gains.

San Francisco wages are 50%+ above the national average, but median home prices are 5x the national average. A worker who moves there earns more but spends more, potentially ending up worse off in living standards.

Research by Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti estimates that housing constraints in high-productivity metros have reduced U.S. GDP growth significantly. If workers could move freely to the most productive places, national output would be substantially higher. Instead, restrictive zoning, NIMBY opposition, and geographic constraints (San Francisco is surrounded by water on three sides) limit housing supply and force workers to less productive locations.

### Spatial Mismatch

Jobs and workers don't always align geographically:

**Within metros**: Jobs often concentrate in suburbs (corporate campuses, industrial parks) while affordable housing concentrates in urban cores. Workers without cars struggle to reach employment.

**Across regions**: Good jobs concentrate in coastal metros while affordable housing exists in the heartland. But those places have few good jobs.

**Skill mismatch**: Local jobs may not match local skills. A displaced factory worker in Ohio may have the wrong skills for growing healthcare or tech sectors---and those sectors may not exist locally anyway.

These mismatches reduce efficiency and opportunity. Workers who "should" move often don't, because of housing costs, family ties, home equity, or simple friction.

## The Political Economy of Place

Economic geography shapes political geography. The divergence between thriving metros and struggling rural areas maps onto partisan divisions:

- Urban counties voted Democratic by large margins in 2020; rural counties voted Republican by large margins.
- The counties producing the most GDP voted heavily Democratic; those producing least voted Republican.
- "Red" states often have "blue" metros (Austin in Texas, Atlanta in Georgia) that produce most of the state's economic output.

These patterns reflect real economic differences: urban voters tend to work in sectors (tech, professional services, education) that benefit from globalization and credentialing, while rural voters disproportionately work in sectors (manufacturing, extraction, agriculture) that have faced trade competition and technological displacement.

Economic policy debates---over trade, immigration, climate, taxation---often pit places against each other as much as classes or ideologies.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Economic activity is geographically concentrated.** Five states produce half of GDP. Eight metros produce 30%. Most rural counties are losing population and employment.

2. **Agglomeration economies explain clustering.** Knowledge spillovers, labor pooling, and input sharing make dense metros more productive---but also more expensive.

3. **Superstar cities have pulled away.** A handful of metros (New York, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle) capture disproportionate shares of innovation, productivity growth, and high-wage jobs.

4. **Rural America faces structural challenges.** Resource extraction and agriculture employ fewer workers; distance from metros limits opportunity. Some rural areas thrive, but many decline.

5. **Housing costs constrain mobility.** Workers can't easily move to productive places when housing is unaffordable. This reduces national productivity and opportunity.

6. **Geography shapes politics.** The divergence between prosperous metros and struggling hinterlands maps onto partisan divisions and policy debates.
