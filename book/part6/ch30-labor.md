# 30. Labor Markets and the Workforce

In September 2023, the United Auto Workers launched a strike against all three Detroit automakers simultaneously---a first in the union's history. By November, they had won a 25% wage increase, restored cost-of-living adjustments lost in 2008, and eliminated the two-tier wage system that had divided their membership. The strike reminded Americans that organized labor, though diminished, retains the capacity to reshape industries.

## The State of Organized Labor

Union membership has declined for decades, from roughly 35% of private-sector workers in the 1950s to under 6% today. The total union membership rate---including public sector workers, where unions remain strong---stands at 9.9%, representing 14.3 million workers.

**Union Membership Trends**

| Year | Total Rate | Private Sector | Public Sector |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| 1983 | 20.1% | 16.8% | 36.7% |
| 2000 | 13.4% | 9.0% | 37.5% |
| 2024 | 9.9% | 5.9% | 32.2% |

The divergence between sectors tells the story. Public-sector workers---teachers, firefighters, government employees---maintain union representation at six times the private-sector rate. Private-sector decline reflects deindustrialization, employer resistance, and legal changes that have made organizing increasingly difficult.

## The Major Unions

### Teachers and Public Employees

The largest unions today represent public-sector workers.

**The National Education Association (NEA)**, with roughly 3 million members, is the largest union in the country. It represents public school teachers, administrators, and support staff. The NEA's political operation is formidable; its endorsement carries weight in Democratic primaries, and its members provide campaign volunteers.

**The American Federation of Teachers (AFT)**, with 1.7 million members, is the NEA's smaller counterpart, stronger in urban districts and representing nurses and higher education faculty alongside K-12 teachers.

**AFSCME** (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) represents 1.6 million public-sector workers: clerical staff, corrections officers, social workers, and other government employees. Public-sector unions face different dynamics than private-sector counterparts; their employer is the government, making collective bargaining inherently political.

### Service and Healthcare Workers

**The Service Employees International Union (SEIU)**, with roughly 2 million members, represents the diverse low-wage service economy: hospital workers, janitors, security guards, home health aides. SEIU pioneered the "corporate campaign" strategy---pressuring employers through public relations, shareholder activism, and political action rather than traditional workplace organizing.

**The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)**, with 1.3 million members, represents grocery workers, meatpackers, and retail employees. UFCW's contracts cover workers at Kroger, Albertsons, and other major grocery chains. The union has also organized cannabis dispensary workers as that industry has expanded.

### Industrial Unions

The traditional industrial unions---once the heart of the labor movement---have shrunk with the industries they represent but remain significant.

**The United Auto Workers (UAW)**, despite representing only 375,000 workers (down from over a million in the 1970s), demonstrated renewed militancy in its 2023 strike. The union has expanded beyond automotive manufacturing to represent graduate students at universities, diversifying its membership base.

**The United Steelworkers (USW)**, with 850,000 members, has similarly diversified, representing workers in steel, aluminum, tire and rubber, oil refining, and paper production.

**The International Brotherhood of Teamsters**, with 1.25 million members, represents logistics workers---truckers, warehouse employees, UPS drivers. The Teamsters' 2023 UPS contract, covering 340,000 workers, eliminated two-tier wage classifications and secured substantial wage increases.

### Building Trades

The construction unions maintain relatively high membership within their sector, benefiting from apprenticeship systems that control labor supply and infrastructure spending that creates demand.

**The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)**, with 860,000 members, represents electricians in construction and utilities. **The United Brotherhood of Carpenters** represents 441,000 members in commercial and residential construction.

These unions operate through hiring halls that dispatch workers to jobs, giving unions control over labor supply that most private-sector unions have lost.

## Union Federations

### AFL-CIO

The **AFL-CIO** (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations) serves as the primary federation of American unions, coordinating political action and providing services to affiliated unions. The federation itself does not bargain contracts; that remains the province of member unions.

The AFL-CIO's political operation mobilizes union members for elections, with door-knocking and voter contact that complements financial contributions. Union households remain significantly more likely to vote Democratic than non-union households in similar demographic categories.

### The Change to Win Episode

In 2005, several large unions---including SEIU and the Teamsters---split from the AFL-CIO to form **Change to Win**, arguing the federation was too focused on politics and too little on organizing new members.

The experiment largely failed. Change to Win never developed the capacity its founders envisioned. Most member unions drifted back toward the AFL-CIO---though the Teamsters left in 2022 to become independent rather than rejoin. SEIU's 2025 announcement that it would return to the federation effectively ended Change to Win as a significant entity.

## How Unions Function

### Collective Bargaining

The core union function is negotiating contracts with employers. The process follows a standard pattern:

1. **Preparation**: The union surveys members about priorities, analyzes the employer's financial position, and drafts proposals.

2. **Negotiation**: Representatives of union and management meet, exchanging proposals and counterproposals. The National Labor Relations Act requires both sides to bargain "in good faith," though what this means is contested.

3. **Tentative Agreement**: When negotiators reach a deal, they present a "tentative agreement" (TA) to union leadership.

4. **Ratification**: Members vote to accept or reject the contract. Rejection sends negotiators back to the table.

Contracts typically cover wages, benefits, work rules, grievance procedures, and job security provisions. Most run three to five years, with periodic reopeners on specific issues.

### The Strike

When bargaining fails, unions can strike---withdrawing labor to pressure employers. Strikes are relatively rare (most contracts settle without work stoppages) but remain labor's ultimate weapon.

**Economic strikes**---walkouts over wages and conditions---allow employers to hire permanent replacement workers, though few do so for skilled labor. **Unfair labor practice strikes**---protesting illegal employer conduct---provide stronger legal protections; employers cannot permanently replace ULP strikers.

Strikes impose costs on both sides. Workers forgo wages (union strike funds provide partial support); employers lose production and risk customer defection. The mutual pain creates incentives for settlement.

### The Legal Framework

The **National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)** administers federal labor law for most private-sector workers. The Board conducts union representation elections, investigates unfair labor practices, and adjudicates disputes.

The NLRB's composition---five members appointed by the president---means its decisions shift with administrations. Democratic boards have generally expanded worker organizing rights; Republican boards have restricted them. This policy instability creates uncertainty for both unions and employers.

**Right-to-work laws** in 26 states prohibit union security agreements---provisions requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment. In right-to-work states, unions must represent all workers in a bargaining unit but cannot compel non-members to contribute. This creates free-rider problems that weaken union finances.

Michigan's 2024 repeal of its right-to-work law---the first such repeal in decades---signaled potential change, but most right-to-work states show no signs of following.

## Recent Labor Actions

### The UAW Stand Up Strike (2023)

The UAW's strike against General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis employed a novel strategy: rather than striking all plants at once, the union "stood up" targeted facilities sequentially, keeping employers uncertain about which plants would be hit next.

**Key Outcomes:**
- 25% wage increase over the contract term
- Cost-of-living adjustments restored (eliminated in 2008 concessions)
- Two-tier wage system eliminated (new hires reach top pay in three years)
- Right to strike over future plant closures
- Battery plant workers brought under the master agreement

The strike demonstrated that industrial unions could still win significant gains when conditions were favorable: tight labor markets, strong consumer demand, and record corporate profits.

### UPS Teamsters (2023)

The Teamsters' UPS contract---the largest private-sector collective bargaining agreement, covering 340,000 workers---settled without a strike after the union authorized a walkout.

**Key Outcomes:**
- $7.50/hour wage increase over five years
- Minimum $21/hour for part-time workers
- Air conditioning in new vehicles; heat shields in existing trucks
- Elimination of the "22.4" two-tier driver classification

The threat of a strike during peak summer shipping season gave the Teamsters leverage; UPS could not afford a work stoppage that would redirect packages to FedEx and Amazon.

### New Organizing

Beyond traditional strongholds, unions have attempted to organize workers in sectors with little union history.

**Starbucks Workers United** has organized over 500 stores since 2021, representing roughly 11,000 workers. But no first contract has been reached; Starbucks has contested elections, challenged certification, and bargained slowly. The gap between winning an election and achieving a contract illustrates the limits of current labor law.

**Amazon Labor Union** won a surprise victory at Staten Island's JFK8 warehouse in 2022. Amazon has refused to bargain, challenging the election results through legal proceedings. In 2024, ALU affiliated with the Teamsters, seeking resources and leverage to force Amazon to the table.

These campaigns have generated publicity and worker interest but limited concrete gains. Organizing without achieving contracts leaves workers without representation.

## Alt-Labor and Worker Centers

Outside the traditional union framework, **worker centers** organize low-wage and immigrant workers who face barriers to formal unionization.

Worker centers are typically nonprofit organizations---legally distinct from unions---that provide services, conduct advocacy, and pressure employers without negotiating contracts. Because they are not "labor organizations" under the NLRA, they can engage in tactics (like secondary boycotts) prohibited for unions.

**Examples include:**
- **Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC-United)**: Restaurant worker advocacy
- **NDLON (National Day Laborer Organizing Network)**: Day laborer rights
- **Fight for $15**: Minimum wage campaign (SEIU-backed)

Worker centers fill gaps in the labor movement but cannot substitute for the economic leverage that comes from representing workers in collective bargaining.

## The Gig Economy and Worker Misclassification

A structural challenge facing organized labor extends beyond declining unionization: the growing share of workers classified as independent contractors rather than employees. This "gig economy" or "1099 economy" has permeated virtually every sector of the American economy.

**Scale and Scope**

Estimates vary, but roughly 36% of American workers participate in some form of gig work, though only 10-15% rely on it as primary income. The phenomenon extends far beyond the ride-share and delivery apps that dominate public perception:

- **Transportation**: Uber and Lyft drivers (roughly 2 million), DoorDash and Instacart delivery workers
- **Healthcare**: Travel nurses (agencies provide "gig-like" flexibility), home health aides, locum tenens physicians
- **Construction**: Day laborers, specialty subcontractors who cycle between jobs
- **Professional Services**: Consultants, freelance accountants, contract lawyers
- **Education**: Adjunct faculty (now 70%+ of college instructors), substitute teachers
- **Media and Tech**: Freelance journalists, contract software developers, content moderators

**Why Classification Matters**

Independent contractors lack access to:
- Minimum wage and overtime protections (Fair Labor Standards Act)
- Unemployment insurance
- Workers' compensation
- Employer-provided health insurance and retirement contributions
- The right to organize under the NLRA

For employers, 1099 classification can reduce labor costs by 20-30%---eliminating payroll taxes, benefits, and legal obligations. This creates powerful incentives to structure work as "independent contracting" even when the functional reality resembles employment.

**Legal Battles**

The definition of "employee" versus "contractor" has become a central labor policy battleground. California's AB5 (2019) attempted to reclassify gig workers as employees, but ride-share companies spent $200 million on Proposition 22 (2020) to exempt themselves, creating a special category of "app-based workers" with some benefits but not employee status.

The federal standard remains contested. The Biden administration's Department of Labor issued a rule tightening independent contractor classification; its durability under subsequent administrations is uncertain. The PRO Act, supported by unions, would codify the stricter "ABC test" for contractor status under federal labor law.

**Implications for Organizing**

Gig work poses fundamental challenges for traditional unionism. Workers are dispersed, often work for multiple platforms simultaneously, and lack a stable workplace where organizing can occur. Some unions have adapted: SEIU has organized home care workers classified as contractors; the Teamsters have affiliated with the Amazon Labor Union. But the 1099 model structurally undermines the assumptions of New Deal labor law, which presumed stable employment relationships at fixed locations.

The growth of gig work represents not just a legal classification issue but a broader restructuring of the employment relationship---shifting risk from employers to workers while reducing the leverage that comes from collective action.

## Political Activity

Unions remain significant political actors, though their influence has declined with membership.

**Political Spending**: Unions spent an estimated $280 million or more in the 2024 election cycle, overwhelmingly supporting Democratic candidates. But union political influence extends beyond spending; the mobilization of union members for door-knocking and voter contact provides campaign resources that money cannot directly buy.

**Policy Priorities**: Union political agendas include raising the minimum wage, strengthening labor law (the PRO Act), protecting public-sector bargaining rights, and opposing trade agreements that threaten union jobs. Unions also advocate on broader issues---healthcare, retirement security, education funding---that affect their members.

**Declining Leverage**: As membership has shrunk, so has political influence. Unions remain important within the Democratic coalition but cannot command the policy outcomes they once did. The failure of labor law reform in multiple Democratic administrations---despite union support being essential to Democratic electoral success---illustrates the limits.

## Union Profiles

### United Auto Workers

> **Quick Facts**
> - Founded: 1935
> - Membership: 375,000
> - President: Shawn Fain (elected 2023)
> - Headquarters: Detroit, MI

The UAW's history parallels American industrial history. The union emerged from the sit-down strikes of the 1930s, built the middle class through the postwar decades, and declined with deindustrialization from the 1970s onward.

The 2023 strike represented a turning point. Under President Shawn Fain---elected on a reform slate after a corruption scandal tarnished previous leadership---the union adopted a more confrontational posture than it had shown in decades. The "Stand Up" strategy, the simultaneous targeting of all three automakers, and the explicit framing of the strike as class conflict marked a departure from the collaborative approach that had characterized recent UAW bargaining.

The union's expansion into higher education---representing graduate student workers at NYU, Columbia, the University of California system, and elsewhere---diversifies its base beyond the shrinking automotive sector.

### Service Employees International Union

> **Quick Facts**
> - Founded: 1921
> - Membership: 2 million
> - President: April Verrett (elected 2024)
> - Headquarters: Washington, D.C.

SEIU transformed from a small janitorial union into one of labor's largest and most innovative organizations. Its "Justice for Janitors" campaigns of the 1990s pioneered corporate campaign tactics that targeted building owners rather than cleaning contractors, winning contracts in Los Angeles, Washington, and other cities.

The union's membership reflects the service economy: hospital workers, home care aides, janitors, security guards. These are often low-wage workers in sectors with high turnover, making traditional organizing difficult. SEIU has emphasized political action---including the Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign---as a complement to workplace organizing.

SEIU's 2005 departure from the AFL-CIO to found Change to Win reflected frustration with the labor movement's direction. The union's 2025 return to the federation suggests that era of experimentation has ended.

### International Brotherhood of Teamsters

> **Quick Facts**
> - Founded: 1903
> - Membership: 1.25 million
> - President: Sean O'Brien (elected 2021)
> - Headquarters: Washington, D.C.

The Teamsters' history includes both remarkable achievements and notorious corruption. The union organized long-haul trucking, built pension funds that provided retirement security, and wielded political influence that commanded respect. It also harbored organized crime connections that led to federal oversight lasting until 2020.

Today's Teamsters have moved beyond trucking to represent workers across logistics: UPS drivers, warehouse workers, airline ground crews, beverage distributors. The 2023 UPS contract demonstrated the union's continued capacity to win major gains when it chooses confrontation.

The union's political positioning is less predictably Democratic than other major unions. President O'Brien spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, reflecting the Teamsters' willingness to engage across party lines---and the reality that many Teamster members vote Republican.

## Exercises

### Review Questions

1. Union membership in the private sector has fallen from 16.8% in 1983 to 5.9% in 2024, while public-sector unionization has remained above 32%. Identify and explain at least three structural factors that account for this divergence. Why are public-sector workers easier to organize and harder to replace than their private-sector counterparts?

2. The UAW's 2023 "Stand Up Strike" employed a novel sequential targeting strategy rather than striking all plants simultaneously. Explain the tactical logic of this approach: how did uncertainty about which plants would be struck next give the union leverage? Why were tight labor markets, strong consumer demand, and record corporate profits essential preconditions for the strike's success? Could this strategy succeed in a recession?

3. The chapter describes the Starbucks Workers United campaign as having organized over 500 stores but reached no first contract. Explain why there is a "gap between winning an election and achieving a contract" under current labor law. What specific employer tactics---contesting elections, challenging certification, slow bargaining---exploit weaknesses in the NLRA framework? How does the Amazon Labor Union's experience reinforce this pattern?

4. Distinguish between economic strikes and unfair labor practice (ULP) strikes in terms of legal protections for workers. Why does the employer's right to hire permanent replacement workers in economic strikes dramatically alter the balance of power in collective bargaining? How does this legal framework compare to labor law in other developed nations where permanent replacement is prohibited?

5. Explain why worker classification as "independent contractor" versus "employee" has become a central labor policy battleground. What specific protections (minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, NLRA organizing rights) are lost when workers are classified as 1099 contractors? Why did ride-share companies spend $200 million on California's Proposition 22, and what does the resulting special category of "app-based workers" reveal about the political economy of classification?

6. The chapter describes "alt-labor" organizations such as worker centers (ROC-United, NDLON, Fight for $15) as filling gaps in the labor movement. How do worker centers differ legally from unions under the NLRA? What tactics can they employ that unions cannot (such as secondary boycotts), and what core union functions (collective bargaining, contract enforcement) can they not perform? Evaluate whether worker centers represent a viable long-term alternative to traditional unionism or a supplement to it.

7. The Teamsters' political positioning is described as "less predictably Democratic" than other major unions, with President O'Brien speaking at the 2024 Republican National Convention. What does this bipartisan engagement reveal about the political tensions within the labor movement? How does the reality that "many Teamster members vote Republican" complicate the assumption that unions are uniformly aligned with one party? What policy areas might create cross-partisan appeal for organized labor?

### Data Exercises

1. **Union Wage Premium by Industry.** Using the BLS Union Members Summary (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.toc.htm) and the Current Population Survey data available through FRED, compare median weekly earnings for union and non-union workers across at least five industries (e.g., construction, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, transportation). Calculate the "union wage premium" (percentage difference) for each industry. Then retrieve the FRED series for real median weekly earnings (LES1252881600Q) and plot the long-run trend. Write a one-page analysis discussing whether the declining union membership rate documented in the chapter has coincided with stagnation in median real wages, and what other factors might explain the correlation (or lack thereof).

2. **Mapping Right-to-Work and Union Density.** Using BLS data on union membership rates by state (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t05.htm), create a table comparing union membership rates in right-to-work states versus non-right-to-work states. Then retrieve state-level median household income data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (https://data.census.gov). Calculate the average union membership rate and median household income for each group. Does the data support or complicate the argument that right-to-work laws weaken unions and reduce worker earnings? Discuss confounding factors (regional cost of living, industry mix, state demographics) that would need to be controlled for in a rigorous analysis.

3. **Gig Economy Scale and Growth.** The chapter notes that "roughly 36% of American workers participate in some form of gig work." Using BLS data on contingent and alternative employment arrangements (https://www.bls.gov/cps/contingent-and-alternative-arrangements-faqs.htm) and FRED series for the number of unincorporated self-employed workers (LNS12032192), track how non-traditional employment has changed over the past two decades. Supplement with data from the Census Bureau's Nonemployer Statistics (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html), which counts businesses with no paid employees. Write a brief report (500--750 words) evaluating whether official statistics adequately capture the gig economy or whether measurement gaps make it difficult to assess the true scale of independent contracting.

### Deeper Investigation

1. The chapter describes Michigan's 2024 repeal of its right-to-work law as "the first such repeal in decades." Research the political and economic context of this repeal: What political conditions made it possible? What arguments did proponents and opponents make? Drawing on BLS union membership data, economic performance indicators from FRED (state employment growth, wage growth, GDP growth), and academic research on right-to-work laws' effects, evaluate the likely economic impact of the repeal on Michigan's labor market. Compare Michigan's experience with that of states that recently enacted right-to-work legislation (e.g., Indiana in 2012, Wisconsin in 2015). Does the available evidence support clear conclusions about the economic effects of right-to-work laws, or does the research remain contested? Write a research paper (1,500--2,000 words) that engages with evidence on both sides.
