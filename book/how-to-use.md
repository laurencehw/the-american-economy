## Conventions

### Data Sources

Throughout the book, I cite data from standard government sources:

- **BEA**: Bureau of Economic Analysis (GDP, industry accounts)
- **BLS**: Bureau of Labor Statistics (employment, wages)
- **Census**: Census Bureau (business establishments, trade)
- **Fed**: Federal Reserve (financial data, flow of funds)

### Industry Classification

Industries are classified using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). See Appendix C for a reference guide.

### Dollar Figures

Unless otherwise noted, dollar figures are nominal (not adjusted for inflation) and refer to the 2022-2023 period.

### Firm Data

When discussing specific companies, data typically comes from SEC filings (10-K annual reports) for public companies, or from industry sources for private companies.

## Reading Paths

You don't need to read this book front-to-back. Here are some suggested paths:

**For a broad overview**: Read Part I (Chapters 1-3) to understand the overall structure, then dip into specific sectors of interest.

**For regional analysis**: Start with Chapter 3 (Geography), then read the relevant regional chapter in Part V.

**For policy context**: Focus on Part VI (Institutions and Governance) and the regulation sections within sector chapters.

**For financial analysis**: Read Part III (Financial Architecture) and Chapter 8 (Finance and Insurance).
