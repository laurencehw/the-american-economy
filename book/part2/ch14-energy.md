# Chapter 14. Energy

The United States consumes more energy than any country except China, burning through roughly 100 quadrillion BTUs annually---the equivalent of 20 million barrels of oil per day. This energy powers an $800 billion sector that spans oil fields in the Permian Basin, natural gas pipelines crisscrossing the continent, nuclear plants operating since the 1970s, wind farms across the Great Plains, and solar installations spreading across rooftops and deserts. The American energy system is simultaneously ancient (some coal plants date to the 1950s) and revolutionary (solar costs have fallen 90% in a decade). Understanding energy means understanding both the legacy infrastructure that still dominates and the transformation now underway.

## Overview

**Size and Scope**
- Total energy spending: ~$1.5 trillion annually
  - Electricity: ~$450 billion (retail sales)
  - Petroleum products: ~$600 billion
  - Natural gas (non-electric): ~$150 billion
  - Other: ~$300 billion
- GDP contribution: ~$500 billion directly (utilities, extraction, refining); ~$800 billion including related sectors
- Employment: ~1.2 million direct (utilities, extraction, refining); ~3 million including support services
- Key subsectors: Electric utilities, oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining, pipelines, renewable generation, energy services

Energy's direct share of GDP (~3-4%) understates its importance. Energy is an input to every other sector: manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and buildings all depend on reliable, affordable energy. Energy price shocks ripple through the economy; energy geography shapes regional development; energy policy drives some of the largest investment flows in the economy.

The sector is also unusually capital-intensive. A single nuclear plant costs $20-30 billion; a major offshore oil platform $1-5 billion; even utility-scale solar projects run hundreds of millions. This capital intensity creates long asset lives, path dependence, and high barriers to entry.

## How the Industry Works

### Electricity: Generation, Transmission, and Distribution

Electricity is unique among commodities: it cannot be economically stored at scale (yet), so supply must match demand instantaneously. This physical constraint shapes everything about how the industry operates.

**Generation** (~4,200 TWh annually):

| Source | Share (2024) | Trend |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Natural gas | 43% | Growing (replaced coal) |
| Coal | 16% | Declining rapidly |
| Nuclear | 18% | Stable (aging fleet) |
| Wind | 11% | Growing rapidly |
| Solar | 6% | Growing very rapidly |
| Hydro | 6% | Stable |

The generation mix has transformed in 15 years. In 2008, coal provided 48% of US electricity; natural gas 21%. The shale revolution made gas cheap; environmental regulation made coal expensive. Coal's share has fallen by two-thirds.

**Transmission** moves power from generators to load centers over high-voltage lines (100-765 kV). The US has three largely separate grids:
- **Eastern Interconnection**: East of the Rockies (except Texas)
- **Western Interconnection**: West of the Rockies
- **ERCOT**: Texas only (deliberately isolated to avoid federal regulation)

Limited transmission between these interconnections constrains the ability to balance supply and demand across regions.

**Distribution** delivers power from substations to end users over lower-voltage lines. Distribution utilities---often the same companies that own transmission---maintain local networks and handle customer billing.

**Retail Sales** (~$450 billion):

| Customer Class | Share of Sales | Share of Revenue |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Residential | 38% | 44% |
| Commercial | 36% | 35% |
| Industrial | 26% | 21% |

Residential customers pay the highest rates (~15 cents/kWh national average); industrial customers the lowest (~8 cents/kWh) due to volume and load characteristics.

### The Two Models: Regulated vs. Restructured

Electricity operates under two fundamentally different market structures:

**Regulated/Vertically Integrated** (~30 states):
- A single utility owns generation, transmission, and distribution
- Utility earns a regulated rate of return on invested capital
- State Public Utility Commission (PUC) approves rates and investments
- No wholesale competition; utility must serve all load
- Dominant in the South, West, and much of the Midwest

**Restructured/Deregulated** (~20 states + DC):
- Generation separated from transmission/distribution
- Competitive wholesale markets operated by Independent System Operators (ISOs)
- Retail choice: customers can buy from competing suppliers (in some states)
- Transmission and distribution remain regulated monopolies
- Dominant in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Texas, and parts of the Midwest

The restructuring wave of the 1990s-2000s promised lower prices through competition. Results have been mixed: wholesale markets are more efficient, but retail prices in restructured states are generally *higher* than in regulated states (partly due to regional cost differences).

### Oil and Gas: From Wellhead to Pump

**Upstream (Exploration and Production)**:

US oil production collapsed from 10 million barrels/day (1970) to 5 million (2008), then surged back to 13+ million (2024)---making America the world's largest producer. The **shale revolution** unlocked tight oil and gas through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.

Key producing regions:
- **Permian Basin** (West Texas/New Mexico): Largest US oil field, ~6 million bbl/day
- **Eagle Ford** (South Texas): ~1 million bbl/day
- **Bakken** (North Dakota): ~1 million bbl/day
- **Appalachian Basin** (PA, WV, OH): Largest gas field (Marcellus/Utica shale)
- **Haynesville** (LA/TX): Major gas production

**Midstream (Transportation and Storage)**:

Oil and gas move through an extensive pipeline network:
- ~190,000 miles of oil pipelines
- ~320,000 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines
- ~2.2 million miles of natural gas distribution pipelines

Major pipeline companies: Energy Transfer, Kinder Morgan, Enterprise Products, Williams Companies. Pipelines are regulated as common carriers (must provide non-discriminatory access) but earn market-based returns.

**Downstream (Refining and Marketing)**:

US refining capacity: ~18 million barrels/day across ~130 refineries. Refining is concentrated on the Gulf Coast (Texas, Louisiana) due to proximity to oil production and port access.

Major refiners: Marathon Petroleum, Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, Chevron.

Refined products flow to retail through:
- Company-owned stations (declining)
- Branded franchises (Shell, ExxonMobil, BP stations owned by franchisees)
- Unbranded independents

### Renewables: The New Entrants

**Wind Power** (~150 GW installed capacity):
- Concentrated in the Great Plains (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas)
- Utility-scale wind is now cost-competitive with gas in good wind areas
- Major developers: NextEra, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Invenergy, AES

**Solar Power** (~175 GW installed capacity):
- Utility-scale: California, Texas, Florida lead
- Distributed (rooftop): California dominates (~40% of US rooftop solar)
- Costs have fallen 90% since 2010
- Major developers: NextEra, AES, Clearway, Array Technologies

**Battery Storage** (~30 GW installed, growing rapidly):
- Paired with solar to provide dispatchable power
- Grid-scale batteries reaching 4+ hours duration
- California, Texas, Arizona leading deployment

The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) provides 10-year tax credits for wind, solar, and storage, accelerating deployment. Annual utility-scale solar installations are expected to reach 50+ GW by 2030.

## Industry Structure

### Electric Utilities

The electric utility industry is fragmented but consolidating:

**Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs)**: ~170 companies, serving ~70% of customers
- Publicly traded, profit-seeking
- Largest by market cap: NextEra ($140B), Southern Company ($80B), Duke Energy ($75B)
- Subject to state PUC regulation

**Public Power**: ~2,000 entities, serving ~15% of customers
- Owned by municipalities, states, or federal government
- Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA): Largest public utility
- Los Angeles DWP, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, others
- Nonprofit; rates set by governing boards

**Cooperatives**: ~900 co-ops, serving ~15% of customers
- Member-owned, primarily rural
- Formed in 1930s-40s to electrify rural America
- National Rural Electric Cooperative Association represents the sector

**Largest US Electric Utilities** (by retail sales):

| Rank | Utility | Customers | States | Type |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Duke Energy | 8.2M | NC, SC, FL, IN, OH, KY | IOU |
| 2 | Southern Company | 9.0M | GA, AL, MS | IOU |
| 3 | Dominion Energy | 7.0M | VA, NC, SC | IOU |
| 4 | Florida Power & Light (NextEra) | 5.8M | FL | IOU |
| 5 | Pacific Gas & Electric | 5.5M | CA | IOU |
| 6 | Xcel Energy | 3.8M | MN, CO, TX, WI, etc. | IOU |
| 7 | TVA | 10M (wholesale) | TN region | Federal |

### Independent System Operators (ISOs/RTOs)

In restructured markets, ISOs/RTOs operate wholesale markets and manage the grid:

| ISO/RTO | Region | Load (TWh) | States |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| PJM | Mid-Atlantic | 800 | PA, NJ, MD, VA, OH, etc. |
| MISO | Midwest | 680 | IL, IN, MI, MN, etc. |
| ERCOT | Texas | 450 | TX only |
| ISO-NE | New England | 120 | MA, CT, NH, VT, ME, RI |
| NYISO | New York | 150 | NY |
| CAISO | California | 230 | CA |
| SPP | Great Plains | 250 | KS, OK, NE, etc. |

ISOs run day-ahead and real-time energy markets using **locational marginal pricing (LMP)**: prices vary by location based on generation costs and transmission constraints. They also run capacity markets (to ensure adequate generation) and ancillary service markets (for grid stability).

### Oil and Gas Companies

**Integrated Majors** (upstream, midstream, and downstream):

| Company | Market Cap | US Production | Focus |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| ExxonMobil | $450B | 3.8M boe/day | Global integrated |
| Chevron | $280B | 3.0M boe/day | Global integrated |

**Large Independents** (primarily upstream):

| Company | Market Cap | US Production | Focus |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| ConocoPhillips | $130B | 1.9M boe/day | E&P only |
| EOG Resources | $70B | 1.0M boe/day | Shale (Permian, Eagle Ford) |
| Pioneer Natural Resources | Acquired by Exxon | - | Was largest Permian pure-play |
| Occidental Petroleum | $50B | 1.2M boe/day | Permian, carbon capture |
| Devon Energy | $30B | 660K boe/day | Multi-basin shale |

The Permian Basin has driven consolidation: ExxonMobil acquired Pioneer ($60B, 2024); Chevron acquired PDC Energy and attempted Hess; Occidental acquired Anadarko (2019).

**Oilfield Services** (equipment, drilling, completion):

| Company | Revenue | Business |
|---------|---------|----------|
| SLB (Schlumberger) | $35B | Drilling, reservoir |
| Halliburton | $23B | Completion, production |
| Baker Hughes | $27B | Equipment, digital |

### Renewable Developers

**Leading US Renewable Developers**:

| Company | Capacity | Business Model |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| NextEra Energy Resources | 32 GW | Utility subsidiary, wind/solar |
| Berkshire Hathaway Energy | 15 GW | Utility + merchant |
| AES Clean Energy | 12 GW | Independent developer |
| Invenergy | 10 GW | Private, wind/solar/storage |
| Clearway Energy | 8 GW | Public yieldco |

NextEra is the dominant player, having built more wind and solar than any other company. Its utility subsidiary (Florida Power & Light) provides stable cash flows to fund renewable development.

## Geographic Distribution

### Energy Production Geography

America's energy geography creates a fundamental divide between **producing states** and **consuming states**:

**Top Oil Producing States** (million bbl/day):
1. Texas: 5.5
2. New Mexico: 1.8
3. North Dakota: 1.1
4. Colorado: 0.4
5. Alaska: 0.4

**Top Natural Gas Producing States** (trillion cubic feet/year):
1. Texas: 11.0
2. Pennsylvania: 7.5
3. Louisiana: 4.0
4. West Virginia: 2.5
5. Oklahoma: 2.3

**Top Coal Producing States** (million short tons):
1. Wyoming: 230 (Powder River Basin)
2. West Virginia: 70
3. Pennsylvania: 40

**Wind Generation Leaders**:
1. Texas: 40 GW
2. Iowa: 12 GW
3. Oklahoma: 12 GW
4. Kansas: 8 GW

**Solar Generation Leaders**:
1. California: 40 GW
2. Texas: 20 GW
3. Florida: 10 GW
4. North Carolina: 8 GW

### Energy Consumption Geography

Energy consumption follows population and industrial activity:

**Highest Per Capita Energy Use**:
- Louisiana, Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota: Industrial activity (refining, mining)
- Texas: Large state with heavy industry and hot climate

**Lowest Per Capita Energy Use**:
- California, New York, New England: Mild climates, service economies, efficiency policies

### The Grid Geography

The US grid reflects historical development rather than optimal design:

- **Eastern Interconnection**: 70% of US load, relatively well-interconnected
- **Western Interconnection**: Less interconnected internally; California imports from neighbors
- **ERCOT**: Deliberately isolated; Texas's 2021 blackout showed the risks

Transmission constraints limit the ability to move cheap renewable power (from windy Plains or sunny Southwest) to population centers (coasts, Midwest cities). Building new transmission faces permitting challenges, landowner opposition, and cost allocation disputes.

## The Workforce

### Employment by Segment

| Segment | Employment | Avg Wage | Trend |
|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| Oil and gas extraction | 150,000 | $100,000 | Cyclical |
| Mining support (drilling, services) | 300,000 | $65,000 | Cyclical |
| Electric utilities | 400,000 | $90,000 | Stable |
| Natural gas distribution | 100,000 | $80,000 | Stable |
| Petroleum refining | 60,000 | $95,000 | Declining |
| Pipeline transportation | 50,000 | $85,000 | Stable |
| Solar installation | 250,000 | $50,000 | Growing rapidly |
| Wind technicians | 15,000 | $60,000 | Growing |

**Total direct energy employment**: ~1.3 million
**Including indirect/induced**: ~3 million

### Workforce Characteristics

**Oil and gas**: Highly cyclical; hiring surges when oil prices rise, mass layoffs when they fall. The 2014-2016 and 2020 downturns each eliminated 100,000+ jobs. Workers must be mobile (go where the drilling is) and accept shift schedules.

**Utilities**: Stable but aging workforce. Many utility workers are 50+; retirements are creating succession challenges. Strong union presence (IBEW, UWUA).

**Solar**: Fastest-growing energy occupation, but jobs tend to be lower-wage than traditional energy. Installation is labor-intensive but doesn't require specialized credentials (unlike utility or oil/gas work).

**Geographic concentration**: Energy jobs concentrate in producing regions (Texas, Gulf Coast, Appalachia, Rockies). The energy transition implies job losses in some regions (coal communities) and gains in others (solar manufacturing, offshore wind ports).

## Regulation and Policy

### Federal Regulators

**Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)**:
- Regulates interstate electricity transmission and wholesale markets
- Regulates interstate natural gas pipelines
- Approves major infrastructure projects (LNG terminals, pipelines)
- Sets transmission rates and market rules
- Does NOT regulate retail electricity (state jurisdiction)

**Department of Energy (DOE)**:
- National laboratories and research
- Strategic Petroleum Reserve
- Energy efficiency standards (appliances, vehicles)
- Nuclear waste management
- Administers IRA clean energy programs

**Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**:
- Air quality standards affecting power plants
- Greenhouse gas regulations (Clean Power Plan / Inflation Reduction Act)
- Vehicle emissions standards
- Refinery and pipeline regulations

**Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)**:
- Licenses and regulates nuclear power plants
- Oversees nuclear waste storage

### State Regulators

**Public Utility Commissions (PUCs)**:
- Set retail electricity and gas rates
- Approve utility investments and power purchases
- Enforce reliability standards
- Implement renewable portfolio standards

State PUCs have enormous power over utility decisions. A PUC that denies cost recovery for a plant effectively kills the project. PUCs vary widely in approach: some prioritize low rates; others environmental goals; others utility financial health.

**State Environmental Agencies**:
- Implement federal environmental law
- May set stricter standards than federal (California)
- Permit power plants and refineries

### Key Policy Frameworks

**Renewable Portfolio Standards**: 30+ states require utilities to obtain a percentage of power from renewables. California: 100% clean by 2045. Texas: No RPS but strong market for renewables anyway.

**Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: Largest US climate legislation ever:
- 10-year tax credits for wind, solar, storage, nuclear, hydrogen
- EV tax credits and charging infrastructure
- Manufacturing credits (solar panels, batteries, etc.)
- Estimated $370 billion in climate spending over 10 years

**Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021)**:
- Grid modernization funding
- EV charging network buildout
- Hydrogen hubs
- Carbon capture demonstrations

## Trade Associations and Lobbying

### Major Trade Associations

| Association | Members | Focus |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Edison Electric Institute (EEI) | Investor-owned utilities | Utility industry interests |
| American Petroleum Institute (API) | Oil and gas companies | Oil/gas production, refining |
| American Gas Association | Natural gas utilities | Gas distribution |
| American Clean Power Association | Renewables developers | Wind, solar, storage |
| Solar Energy Industries Association | Solar companies | Solar policy |
| Nuclear Energy Institute | Nuclear operators | Nuclear power |
| National Rural Electric Cooperative Association | Electric co-ops | Rural electric interests |

### Lobbying Activity

Energy is among the most heavily lobbied sectors:
- Oil and gas: ~$125 million annually in federal lobbying
- Electric utilities: ~$100 million
- Renewable energy: ~$30 million (growing)

Key lobbying issues: Tax treatment, permitting, environmental regulation, grid rules, trade policy (tariffs on solar panels, LNG exports).

The industry contributes heavily to campaigns, particularly in energy-producing states. Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wyoming politics are shaped by oil and gas interests.

## Recent Trends

### 1. The Shale Revolution Matures

US oil production peaked at 13 million bbl/day (2019), fell during COVID, and has recovered to near-record levels. But the industry is changing:

- **Capital discipline**: After burning through investor capital in the 2010s, shale producers now prioritize returns over growth
- **Consolidation**: Majors are acquiring independents (Exxon-Pioneer, Chevron-PDC)
- **Productivity plateau**: Well productivity gains are slowing; Tier 1 acreage is being depleted
- **Permian dominance**: The Permian Basin accounts for nearly half of US oil production

### 2. Coal's Collapse

Coal generation has fallen by two-thirds since 2008:
- 2008: 48% of US generation
- 2024: 16% of US generation

Coal plants are retiring faster than regulators expected. The remaining fleet is aging (average plant is 45+ years old), and economics favor gas and renewables. Some regions (Appalachia, Powder River Basin) face severe economic disruption.

### 3. The Renewable Buildout

Wind and solar now provide 17% of US electricity (up from 3% in 2010). The IRA has accelerated deployment:
- 2023: 32 GW of utility-scale solar added
- 2024: 40+ GW expected
- Battery storage growing 50%+ annually

Challenges remain: Grid interconnection queues are 5+ years long; permitting delays kill projects; supply chains face constraints.

### 4. Grid Reliability Concerns

Rapid change is straining grid reliability:
- **Texas (February 2021)**: Winter storm caused 4+ days of blackouts; 200+ deaths
- **California (rolling blackouts)**: Tight margins during heat waves
- **Interconnection backlogs**: New generation can't connect fast enough

Dispatchable generation (gas, nuclear) is retiring faster than storage and demand response can compensate. Grid operators warn of increasing reliability risks.

### 5. The Nuclear Question

The existing nuclear fleet (93 GW, 54 plants) provides 18% of US generation---all carbon-free. But:
- No new conventional plants since 2016 (Vogtle 3&4 in Georgia finally completed, massively over budget)
- Several plants have closed or announced closure (economics, not safety)
- Small modular reactors (SMRs) are years away from commercial deployment

Nuclear's future depends on whether it's valued for reliability and carbon-free generation. Some states (Illinois, New York, California) have subsidized plants to prevent closure.

### 6. Electrification and Load Growth

After decades of flat electricity demand, load growth is resuming:
- **EVs**: Each 1% EV penetration adds ~0.3% to electricity demand
- **Data centers**: AI/cloud computing driving massive data center construction
- **Electrification**: Heat pumps, industrial electrification
- **Hydrogen/manufacturing**: IRA incentives driving new industrial load

Utilities that planned for flat demand now face potential shortages. Load growth could reach 2-3% annually---rates not seen since the 1990s.

## Firm Profiles

### NextEra Energy

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Juno Beach, FL
> - Market Cap: ~$140 billion
> - Employees: ~16,000
> - CEO: John Ketchum

NextEra Energy is the world's largest generator of wind and solar power---and also Florida's largest electric utility. This combination of regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) and competitive renewables developer (NextEra Energy Resources) has made NextEra the most valuable utility in America.

**Florida Power & Light (FPL)**: Serves 5.8 million customer accounts (12 million people) across Florida. FPL is known for operational efficiency, low rates by Florida standards, and aggressive solar deployment (Florida's largest solar fleet).

**NextEra Energy Resources (NEER)**: The competitive subsidiary, operating 32 GW of wind, solar, and storage across North America. NEER pioneered utility-scale wind development in the 2000s and has maintained market leadership through scale, low cost of capital, and sophisticated power marketing.

The company's strategy: use FPL's regulated cash flows to fund NEER's growth, while maintaining investment-grade credit. NextEra has outperformed the utility sector for two decades.

Challenges: Rising interest rates (which affect all capital-intensive developers); Florida's hurricane exposure; regulatory risk in states skeptical of renewables.

### ExxonMobil

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Spring, TX (Houston area)
> - Market Cap: ~$450 billion
> - Employees: ~62,000
> - CEO: Darren Woods

ExxonMobil is the largest US oil company and one of the largest in the world, tracing its history to Standard Oil (broken up in 1911). The company operates across the petroleum value chain:

**Upstream**: Major positions in the Permian Basin (acquired Pioneer Natural Resources for $60B in 2024), Guyana (massive offshore discoveries), and global LNG. Production: ~3.8 million boe/day.

**Downstream**: Largest US refiner (4.6 million bbl/day capacity globally), major chemicals producer (polyethylene, polypropylene).

**Low Carbon Solutions**: Investing in carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels---though critics argue the pace is too slow. ExxonMobil has been more skeptical of the energy transition than European peers (Shell, BP, TotalEnergies).

ExxonMobil's strategy under CEO Darren Woods emphasizes maximizing returns from oil and gas rather than pivoting to renewables. The Pioneer acquisition doubled Permian production, betting on continued oil demand.

The company has faced climate litigation, shareholder activism, and reputational challenges. But ExxonMobil remains enormously profitable when oil prices are high, generating $50+ billion in net income in 2022.

### Duke Energy

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Charlotte, NC
> - Market Cap: ~$75 billion
> - Employees: ~27,000
> - CEO: Lynn Good

Duke Energy exemplifies the large regulated utility: predictable, capital-intensive, politically connected, and facing the challenges of energy transition.

Duke serves 8.2 million electric customers across six states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky), plus 1.6 million gas customers. The company operates as regulated monopolies in all service territories---no competitive markets.

**Generation portfolio**: Historically coal-heavy, Duke has been transitioning to gas and renewables. The company operates nuclear plants in the Carolinas and is exploring SMRs. Coal retirement timelines are contentious: North Carolina regulators push faster; Duke seeks gradual transition.

**Regulatory relationships**: Duke's business depends on PUC approval of investments and rates. The company maintains close relationships with state regulators and legislatures---critics say too close. Duke has faced criticism for coal ash cleanup costs, rate increases, and political influence.

**Clean energy transition**: Duke has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets. But execution faces challenges: grid reliability concerns, coal plant retirement schedules, and the need for massive transmission investment.

Duke illustrates the tensions facing traditional utilities: pressure to decarbonize, need to maintain reliability, desire to grow rate base, and exposure to regulatory and political risk.
