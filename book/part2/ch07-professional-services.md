# 7. Professional and Business Services

Walk into any office tower in Manhattan, downtown Chicago, or San Francisco's Financial District and you'll find floors of lawyers, consultants, accountants, and software engineers—the knowledge workers who power the professional services economy. This sector, often invisible to consumers who never hire a management consultant or M&A attorney, quietly accounts for over $2 trillion in annual output and employs more than 20 million Americans.

Professional and business services (NAICS 54-56) encompasses an extraordinarily diverse set of industries united by one feature: they sell expertise rather than physical goods. A law firm sells legal judgment; McKinsey sells strategic advice; Deloitte sells audit opinions and tax planning; advertising agencies sell creative campaigns and media placement. These services are produced by highly educated workers, concentrated in major metropolitan areas, and increasingly central to how the modern economy functions.

## Overview

### Size and Scope

- **GDP contribution (2023)**: $2.3 trillion (approximately 9% of GDP)
- **Employment**: 22.4 million workers (Professional, Scientific, Technical Services: 10.2M; Administrative Services: 9.5M; Management of Companies: 2.7M)
- **Establishments**: Over 1.1 million firms
- **Growth**: One of the fastest-growing sectors over the past three decades

Professional services has been a major engine of employment growth since the 1980s. While manufacturing employment fell from 19 million to 13 million between 1980 and 2023, professional and business services employment more than doubled. This shift reflects the broader transformation from a goods-producing to a knowledge-based economy.

## How the Industry Works

Professional services firms share a distinctive business model that differs fundamentally from manufacturing or retail. They sell hours of expert time, face severe information asymmetries with clients, and depend critically on reputation and relationships.

### The Leverage Model

Most professional services firms operate on a **leverage model**: a small number of senior partners supervise a larger number of junior professionals who do the bulk of the work. The economics are straightforward:

- Partners bill at $1,000-2,000/hour (or more for elite specialists)
- Associates bill at $300-600/hour
- Partners capture the spread between what they bill for associates' time and what associates are paid

The **leverage ratio** (associates per partner) determines profitability. A law firm with 4 associates per partner earns more per partner than one with 2 associates per partner, all else equal. But higher leverage requires more work to keep associates busy—creating pressure to grow revenue.

This model creates a distinctive career structure: the **tournament**. Junior professionals compete for a limited number of partner slots. Those who make partner earn substantial equity stakes; those who don't typically leave ("up or out"). Marc Galanter and Thomas Palay's *Tournament of Lawyers* (1991) formalized this model for law firms, but it applies broadly across consulting, accounting, and investment banking.

### Revenue Streams

**Hourly billing** remains dominant in legal services and much of accounting. Clients pay for time spent, creating incentives for efficiency (clients want less time) and inefficiency (firms want more billable hours) that are never fully resolved.

**Project-based fees** are common in consulting and advertising. McKinsey might charge $5-10 million for a three-month strategy project, regardless of hours worked. This aligns incentives with outcomes but requires accurate scoping.

**Contingency fees** (plaintiff's litigation) and **success fees** (M&A advisory) tie compensation to results. A plaintiff's attorney might take 33% of any settlement; an investment bank might earn 1% of deal value. These arrangements shift risk to the service provider.

**Retainer relationships** provide steady revenue: a corporation pays a law firm $500,000/year for on-call legal advice. Retainers smooth revenue but may create conflicts (the retained firm may be reluctant to recommend costly litigation).

**Audit fees** are unique: public companies are legally required to hire independent auditors, creating a quasi-regulated market. The Big 4 accounting firms audit virtually all large public companies, with fees set through negotiation but constrained by competition for the engagement.

### The Role of Reputation

Professional services markets are plagued by **information asymmetry**: clients cannot easily evaluate service quality. How does a CEO know if the law firm's M&A advice is sound? How does an audit committee know if the audit was thorough?

**Reputation** partially solves this problem. Elite firms—Cravath in law, McKinsey in consulting, Goldman Sachs in banking—command premium fees because their reputations assure clients of quality. This creates powerful incumbency advantages and explains why the same firms have dominated their industries for decades.

Reputation also explains the **credentialing function** of professional services. When a company hires McKinsey, it's partly buying analysis but also buying legitimacy: "McKinsey recommended this strategy" provides cover for executives. Similarly, a Big 4 audit opinion signals to investors that financial statements are reliable (or at least, that a reputable firm reviewed them).

## Industry Structure

### Legal Services

The US legal services market ($370 billion) is the world's largest, reflecting both the litigiousness of American society and the complexity of American business law.

**Market structure**: Highly fragmented overall (130,000+ law firms), but concentrated at the top. The AmLaw 100 (largest 100 firms by revenue) generate about 40% of total legal revenue. The AmLaw 10 alone account for nearly $30 billion.

**Largest firms by revenue (2023)**:

| Rank | Firm | Revenue | Lawyers | PPP* |
|------|------|---------|---------|------|
| 1 | Kirkland & Ellis | $7.2B | 3,600 | $7.5M |
| 2 | Latham & Watkins | $5.8B | 3,200 | $5.6M |
| 3 | DLA Piper | $3.7B | 4,500 | $2.1M |
| 4 | Baker McKenzie | $3.4B | 4,700 | $1.6M |
| 5 | Skadden | $3.3B | 1,700 | $5.2M |

*PPP = Profits Per Partner. Source: American Lawyer*

**Specialization**: Large firms increasingly specialize. Kirkland & Ellis dominates private equity work; Wachtell Lipton is the premier M&A defense firm; Quinn Emanuel leads commercial litigation. Specialization allows expertise development but creates "rainmaker" dependency—partners who control client relationships hold enormous power.

**Geographic concentration**: Legal services concentrate in major business centers. New York (especially Midtown Manhattan) hosts the largest cluster, followed by Washington DC (regulatory/government work), Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco/Silicon Valley.

**Key trends**:
- Rising associate salaries (first-year associates at top firms now earn $215,000+)
- Growing in-house legal departments (corporations bringing work inside)
- Alternative Legal Service Providers (ALSPs) handling routine work
- Slow adoption of technology despite "LegalTech" hype

### Accounting and Auditing

The accounting industry is dominated by the **Big 4**: Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG. These firms audit virtually all large public companies and provide tax and consulting services to corporations worldwide.

**Big 4 statistics (2023)**:

| Firm | Global Revenue | US Revenue | US Employees |
|------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Deloitte | $65B | $28B | 175,000 |
| PwC | $53B | $21B | 75,000 |
| EY | $50B | $20B | 78,000 |
| KPMG | $36B | $14B | 40,000 |

*Sources: Firm disclosures*

**Market concentration**: The Big 4's dominance in audit is extraordinary—they audit approximately 99% of S&P 500 companies. This concentration raises concerns about systemic risk (what if a Big 4 firm failed?) and competitive dynamics (limited choice for large companies needing auditors).

**Service lines**: The Big 4 are not just auditors. Revenue breaks down roughly as:
- Audit and assurance: 35-40%
- Tax services: 25-30%
- Consulting/advisory: 30-40%

The mix has shifted toward consulting, which offers higher margins and faster growth than commoditized audit work.

**Regulatory environment**: Auditing is quasi-regulated. The SEC requires public companies to have audited financial statements; the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) inspects audit quality; Sarbanes-Oxley (2002) restricted auditors from providing certain consulting services to audit clients.

**Key tensions**:
- Independence vs. client service (auditors are paid by the companies they audit)
- Quality vs. cost (audit fees are under constant pressure)
- Consulting growth vs. audit independence (conflicts of interest)

### Management Consulting

The management consulting industry ($330 billion in the US) advises corporations on strategy, operations, technology, and organization.

**Market structure**: More fragmented than accounting, but with clear tiers:

**Strategy consulting** (the elite tier):
- McKinsey & Company (~$16B global revenue, ~6,000 US consultants)
- Boston Consulting Group (~$12B global, ~5,000 US)
- Bain & Company (~$6B global, ~3,500 US)

**Big 4 consulting arms** (volume and technology):
- Deloitte Consulting, PwC Advisory, EY-Parthenon, KPMG Advisory

**Technology/implementation consultants**:
- Accenture (~$65B global, massive scale)
- IBM Consulting, Capgemini, Cognizant

**Boutiques and specialists**: Thousands of smaller firms focusing on specific industries or functions.

**Business model**: Strategy consultants sell "thought leadership"—frameworks, analyses, recommendations delivered by teams of bright MBAs working 80-hour weeks. The output is typically a PowerPoint deck presented to executives, though implementation support has become more common.

**Why do companies hire consultants?** Bloom and Van Reenen's research (JEP, 2010) suggests consultants spread best practices across firms, improving management quality. But critics argue consulting often provides "legitimacy" for decisions executives have already made, or serves as an expensive form of benchmarking that could be done more cheaply.

### Computer Systems Design and IT Services

The largest professional services subsector by revenue ($550 billion) encompasses:

- Custom software development
- Systems integration
- IT outsourcing
- Cloud services implementation

**Market structure**: Highly diverse, from global giants to small development shops.

**Major players**:
- Accenture: $65B global revenue, 740,000 employees (the largest)
- IBM Consulting: ~$20B (spun from IBM's services arm)
- Infosys, TCS, Wipro: Indian-headquartered firms with large US operations
- Cognizant: $19B, US-headquartered but India-delivery model
- Thousands of smaller system integrators and consultancies

**Offshore delivery**: Much IT services work is performed offshore (India, Philippines, Eastern Europe) with US-based client management. This "global delivery model" dramatically lowered costs and enabled the industry's growth, but also limited US employment growth in this subsector.

**Cloud transformation**: The shift to cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) has restructured the industry. Implementation of cloud solutions is now a major revenue stream.

### Advertising and Marketing Services

The advertising industry ($280 billion) creates and places marketing communications across media channels.

**Market structure**: Consolidated at the top into four major holding companies:

| Holding Company | Headquarters | Revenue | Major Agencies |
|----------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| WPP | London | $18B | Ogilvy, Grey, GroupM |
| Omnicom | New York | $14B | BBDO, DDB, OMD |
| Publicis | Paris | $14B | Saatchi, Leo Burnett, Starcom |
| IPG | New York | $11B | McCann, FCB, UM |

These holding companies own dozens of individual agencies, allowing them to serve competing clients through different subsidiaries.

**The agency model**: Traditional agencies combine:
- Creative services (developing ad concepts and content)
- Media buying (purchasing ad space/time)
- Account management (client relationships)

**Digital disruption**: The rise of Google and Meta (Facebook) transformed the industry. These platforms now capture over 50% of US digital ad spending, disintermediating traditional media buying. Agencies have responded by building digital capabilities, but their role in a programmatic, algorithm-driven ad market is uncertain.

**The attention economy**: Tim Wu's *The Attention Merchants* (2016) traces the business model of capturing and selling attention from 19th-century newspapers through modern social media. Advertising agencies are intermediaries in this attention market—and increasingly squeezed between powerful platforms and cost-conscious clients.

### Architecture and Engineering Services

A&E services ($380 billion) design buildings, infrastructure, and industrial facilities.

**Market structure**: Highly fragmented. No firm dominates; the largest (AECOM, Jacobs) have market shares under 5%.

**Largest firms (by US revenue)**:

| Firm | US Revenue | Specialty |
|------|------------|-----------|
| AECOM | $8B | Infrastructure, government |
| Jacobs | $7B | Government, industrial |
| WSP | $4B | Transportation, buildings |
| Stantec | $3B | Environmental, buildings |
| HDR | $2.5B | Healthcare, transportation |

**Business model**: Fee-based professional services, typically as a percentage of construction cost (5-15% depending on project complexity). Work is project-based and highly cyclical—architecture billings are a leading indicator of construction activity.

**The AIA Architecture Billings Index**: The American Institute of Architects publishes a monthly index tracking billings at architecture firms. Because design precedes construction by 9-12 months, the ABI serves as an early warning system for construction downturns.

## Geographic Distribution

Professional services are among the most geographically concentrated industries in the American economy.

### Metropolitan Concentration

The top 10 metropolitan areas account for over 50% of professional services employment:

| Metro Area | Prof. Services Employment | Specialization |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| New York-Newark | 1.8 million | Law, finance services, advertising |
| Los Angeles | 900,000 | Entertainment law, tech |
| Chicago | 700,000 | Consulting, accounting |
| Washington DC | 680,000 | Government consulting, law |
| Dallas | 550,000 | Energy consulting, accounting |
| San Francisco Bay | 520,000 | Tech consulting, VC law |
| Boston | 450,000 | Consulting, life sciences |
| Houston | 400,000 | Energy engineering |
| Atlanta | 380,000 | Regional services hub |
| Philadelphia | 340,000 | Pharma consulting, law |

### Why Services Concentrate

Agglomeration economies explain the clustering:

**Knowledge spillovers**: Professionals learn from proximity to other professionals. A lawyer in New York encounters more deal structures, a consultant in Boston more strategic frameworks, than counterparts in smaller markets.

**Thick labor markets**: Concentrated markets make job matching easier. Firms can find specialized talent; workers can find firms matching their expertise.

**Client proximity**: Professional services require intensive client interaction. Lawyers need to be near corporate headquarters; consultants near executive suites. This creates a virtuous cycle: firms locate near clients; sophisticated clients demand sophisticated firms; more firms arrive.

**Signaling and status**: A Manhattan address signals prestige. Clients perceive firms in elite locations as higher quality, allowing them to charge premium fees.

## The Workforce

### Education and Credentials

Professional services employs the most educated workforce in the economy:

| Occupation | Typical Education | Credential |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| Lawyer | J.D. (3 years post-college) | Bar admission |
| CPA | Bachelor's + 150 credit hours | CPA license |
| Management consultant | MBA common, not required | None required |
| Architect | B.Arch or M.Arch | State license |
| Engineer (PE) | B.S. Engineering | Professional Engineer license |

Credentialing creates barriers to entry that limit competition and support high wages. The bar exam, CPA exam, and architectural licensing exam all restrict supply of practitioners.

### Compensation

Professional services wages span an enormous range:

**Entry level**:
- First-year BigLaw associate: $215,000 + bonus
- Big 4 audit associate: $65,000-80,000
- Entry management consultant (MBA): $175,000 + bonus
- Junior architect: $55,000-70,000

**Senior/Partner level**:
- BigLaw equity partner: $2-10+ million
- Big 4 partner: $500,000-2+ million
- McKinsey senior partner: $2-5+ million
- Principal architect: $150,000-300,000

**Wage inequality**: Professional services exhibits extreme within-industry inequality. Partners at elite firms earn 20-50x what junior staff earn. This tournament structure provides strong incentives but creates brutal competition.

### Working Conditions

Professional services is notorious for long hours:

- BigLaw associates: 2,000-2,400 billable hours/year (implying 2,500-3,000 hours worked)
- Investment banking analysts: 80-100 hours/week during deals
- Management consultants: 60-80 hours/week, heavy travel
- Big 4 audit staff: 50-70 hours/week during busy season (January-April)

These hours create work-life balance challenges and contribute to high attrition. Most professionals leave their first employer within 5-7 years—either for partner-track positions elsewhere, in-house roles at corporations, or career changes.

## Regulation and Policy

### Professional Licensing

Most professional services are regulated through state licensing:

- **Lawyers**: State bar associations (under state supreme court supervision)
- **CPAs**: State boards of accountancy
- **Architects**: State licensing boards
- **Engineers**: State boards of professional engineers

Licensing requirements typically include education, examination, and experience. Critics argue licensing restricts competition and raises prices; defenders argue it protects consumers from incompetent practitioners. Hadfield (2022) documents how legal profession regulations limit innovation and access to justice.

### Antitrust and Competition

Professional services historically enjoyed antitrust exemptions (the "learned professions" doctrine). This changed with *Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar* (1975), which held that lawyers are subject to antitrust law.

Current issues include:
- **Non-compete clauses**: Restrict worker mobility; FTC has proposed banning them
- **Professional association rules**: May limit advertising, fee structures, unauthorized practice
- **Big 4 concentration**: Regulators periodically consider whether audit market concentration harms competition

### Sarbanes-Oxley and Audit Reform

The Enron and WorldCom scandals led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), which:
- Created the PCAOB to oversee auditors
- Restricted auditor consulting services to audit clients
- Required CEO/CFO certification of financial statements
- Strengthened audit committee independence requirements

SOX increased audit costs substantially but arguably improved audit quality and corporate governance.

## Trade Associations and Lobbying

### Major Associations

| Association | Members | Focus |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| American Bar Association | 400,000 lawyers | Legal profession standards, lobbying |
| AICPA | 430,000 CPAs | Accounting standards, licensing |
| Management Consultancies Association | Major consulting firms | Industry promotion |
| American Institute of Architects | 98,000 architects | Licensing, building codes |
| 4A's | Advertising agencies | Industry standards, self-regulation |

### Political Activity

Professional services firms are major political donors and lobbyists:

- Law firms rank among the largest political contributors (lawyers skew Democratic)
- Accounting firms lobby heavily on tax policy and audit regulation
- Tech companies (including IT services) have become major lobbying forces

The revolving door between professional services and government is well-traveled: lawyers become judges and regulators; consultants advise campaigns and enter administrations; accountants staff the SEC and IRS.

## Recent Trends

### 1. Technology and Automation

**LegalTech** promises to automate routine legal work—document review, contract analysis, due diligence. Tools like Kira Systems and Luminance use machine learning. So far, adoption has been slow; lawyers remain skeptical and clients haven't demanded change.

**AI in consulting**: McKinsey and others have invested heavily in data analytics and AI capabilities. The question is whether AI enhances consultant productivity or eventually replaces it.

### 2. Alternative Service Providers

**Alternative Legal Service Providers (ALSPs)** like Axiom and UnitedLex offer legal work at lower cost than law firms, using technology and lower-cost labor. The Big 4 accounting firms have also entered legal services (where permitted).

**Gig economy**: Platforms like Upwork and Toptal connect clients directly with freelance professionals, bypassing traditional firms for some work.

### 3. Remote Work

COVID-19 proved that much professional services work can be done remotely. This has implications for:
- Geographic concentration (can firms hire anywhere?)
- Office real estate (do firms need expensive urban space?)
- Work-life balance (or work-life blur?)

The industry is still sorting out the new equilibrium.

### 4. ESG and Purpose

Professional services firms face pressure to demonstrate social responsibility—declining certain clients (fossil fuels, tobacco), improving diversity, addressing climate impact. McKinsey faced reputational damage from opioid-related consulting; law firms have been criticized for representing controversial clients.

## Firm Profiles

### McKinsey & Company

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: New York, NY
> - Founded: 1926
> - Revenue: ~$16 billion (2023, estimated)
> - Employees: 45,000 globally, ~6,000 US consultants

McKinsey is the world's most prestigious management consulting firm, known for advising CEOs on strategy and for producing many corporate and government leaders (current and former clients include numerous Fortune 500 CEOs, cabinet secretaries, and central bank governors).

The firm pioneered many practices now standard in consulting: the case interview, the "up or out" promotion system, and the emphasis on structured problem-solving. McKinsey consultants are known for their frameworks, their PowerPoint decks, and their willingness to render confident judgments on industries they've just encountered.

McKinsey's influence is both celebrated and criticized. *The Lords of Strategy* (Kiechel, 2011) credits McKinsey with inventing modern corporate strategy. Critics argue the firm spreads management fads, enables corporate cost-cutting that harms workers, and has advised authoritarian governments. Recent controversies include work for opioid manufacturers and the Saudi government.

The firm is a partnership; there are no public financial disclosures. But it is believed to be highly profitable, with senior partners earning $5+ million annually.

### Deloitte

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: New York, NY (US entity)
> - Founded: 1845 (London), US practice established 1890s
> - Revenue: $65 billion globally, ~$28 billion US (2023)
> - Employees: 175,000 US, 450,000 globally

Deloitte is the largest professional services firm in the world, offering audit, tax, consulting, and advisory services. In the US, it is the largest of the Big 4 by revenue and headcount.

Unlike consulting boutiques, Deloitte's scale allows it to serve the full range of corporate needs—from annual audits to massive technology implementations to tax planning across dozens of jurisdictions. This breadth is both a strength (one-stop shopping) and a challenge (managing conflicts between audit independence and consulting revenue).

Deloitte has invested heavily in technology and industry specialization. Its consulting arm competes directly with McKinsey and Accenture; its tax practice is the largest in the country. The firm recruits heavily from top universities and business schools, employing a substantial fraction of each year's accounting and MBA graduates.

### AECOM

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Dallas, TX
> - Founded: 1990 (through mergers)
> - Revenue: ~$14 billion (2023)
> - Employees: 50,000

AECOM is the largest architecture and engineering firm in the United States, providing design, construction management, and operations services for infrastructure, buildings, and industrial facilities.

The firm exemplifies the consolidation trend in A&E: it was built through dozens of acquisitions, assembling capabilities across transportation, water, environment, energy, and buildings. Major projects include Los Angeles International Airport modernization, New York's Second Avenue Subway, and numerous military installations.

AECOM's business is heavily tied to government infrastructure spending. It ranks among the largest federal contractors and derives substantial revenue from state and local transportation departments. This makes it sensitive to public sector budget cycles but provides relative stability compared to private-sector-focused competitors.
