# Chapter 15. Education

Americans spend over $1.5 trillion annually on education, making it one of the largest sectors of the economy. Yet the American education "system" is barely a system at all: 13,000 independent school districts, 50 state bureaucracies, 4,000 colleges with wildly different missions, a growing commercial sector of test-prep companies and for-profit schools, and an emerging ed-tech industry promising to disrupt it all. Understanding American education means understanding both the public system that educates most students and the $400+ billion commercial ecosystem built around it.

## Overview

**Size and Scope**
- Total spending: ~$1.6 trillion annually
  - K-12 public: ~$800 billion
  - Higher education: ~$700 billion
  - Private K-12: ~$70 billion
  - Federal direct: ~$100 billion (grants, loans, Title I)
- Employment: ~13 million workers (teachers, professors, administrators, support staff)
- Establishments: ~130,000 K-12 schools, ~4,000 degree-granting colleges
- Key subsectors: K-12 public, K-12 private, higher education, for-profit education, testing and assessment, textbooks and curriculum, education technology

Education's share of GDP is roughly 7%, comparable to healthcare in the 1980s before that sector's explosive growth. Education is the single largest expenditure category for state and local governments, exceeding Medicaid and infrastructure combined.

The sector is unusual because most spending flows through government, but the industry surrounding education---publishers, test makers, technology providers, and for-profit schools---is thoroughly commercial. The College Board, technically a nonprofit, generates $1.5 billion in annual revenue. Pearson, the world's largest education company, is a London-listed corporation. Understanding education in America means understanding both the public mission and the private interests.

## How the Industry Works

### The Public Side: Revenue Flows

K-12 public education is funded from three sources (national averages):
- **Local**: 45% (primarily property taxes)
- **State**: 47% (sales and income taxes, distributed via formulas)
- **Federal**: 8% (targeted programs: Title I for low-income schools, IDEA for special education, school nutrition programs)

This funding structure creates enormous inequality. Districts in wealthy suburbs collect abundant property taxes; districts in poor rural or urban areas cannot. State formulas partially equalize, but gaps persist: New York spends $29,000 per pupil; Utah spends $9,000. Even after cost-of-living adjustment, the ratio exceeds 2:1.

Higher education has a different funding model:
- **Public universities**: State appropriations (declining from 75% in 1980 to ~40% today), tuition (rising), federal research grants, auxiliaries (housing, athletics, hospitals)
- **Private nonprofits**: Tuition, endowment returns, gifts, federal research grants
- **For-profit colleges**: Almost entirely tuition, ~90% from federal student aid

### The Commercial Side: Where the Money Goes

The education sector generates enormous commercial activity beyond direct instruction:

**Textbooks and Curriculum** (~$15 billion market)
- K-12 textbooks: States adopt textbooks on 6-8 year cycles; Texas and California dominate adoption decisions
- Higher ed textbooks: Professors choose; students pay $1,200+ per year; used book and rental markets growing
- Digital curriculum: Increasingly bundled with assessment and learning management systems

**Testing and Assessment** (~$5 billion market)
- Standardized tests: State accountability tests (Pearson, ETS, AIR)
- College admissions: SAT (College Board), ACT
- Professional licensing: Bar exam, CPA, medical boards, teacher certification
- Credential assessments: GED, CLEP, AP exams

**Education Technology** (~$40 billion market, fast-growing)
- Learning management systems (Canvas, Blackboard)
- Online course platforms (Coursera, edX, 2U)
- Tutoring and homework help (Chegg, Varsity Tutors)
- Assessment software and proctoring
- Administrative systems (PowerSchool, Ellucian)

**For-Profit Education** (~$25 billion revenue)
- Online universities (University of Phoenix, Southern New Hampshire, Grand Canyon)
- Career training (coding bootcamps, trade schools)
- Test preparation (Kaplan, Princeton Review)
- K-12 virtual schools (Stride Inc., formerly K12)

### Business Models

**Traditional public education** operates on a cost-plus model: schools receive funding based on enrollment (average daily attendance) and spend it on salaries (80%+ of budgets), facilities, and operations. There is limited competitive pressure; most students attend their assigned school.

**For-profit education** operates on a tuition-extraction model, often dependent on federal financial aid. The infamous "90/10 rule" requires for-profit colleges to derive at least 10% of revenue from non-federal sources---a rule designed to ensure schools provide value beyond capturing government funds. Many for-profits cluster at 89% federal revenue.

**Textbook publishers** operate on an adoption-cycle model: heavy upfront investment in content creation, then years of revenue from adoptions. The shift to digital threatens this model by enabling piracy and unbundling.

**Testing companies** operate on a monopoly or oligopoly model. College Board has no competitor for AP exams. State assessment contracts go to a handful of companies with the capacity to develop, administer, and score tests for millions of students.

## Industry Structure

### Market Concentration

Education is fragmented on the public side, concentrated on the commercial side:

**K-12 Public Education**: Extremely fragmented
- 13,000+ school districts
- Average district serves ~3,800 students
- Largest: NYC (1 million students), LA Unified (600,000)
- Many rural districts serve <500 students

**Higher Education**: Moderately fragmented
- 4,000 degree-granting institutions
- But consolidation increasing: University systems (UC, SUNY, Texas) operate multiple campuses
- Online programs dominated by a handful of mega-enrollers

**Commercial Education**: Concentrated

| Segment | Top Players | Market Structure |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| K-12 Textbooks | Pearson, McGraw-Hill, Cengage, Houghton Mifflin | Oligopoly (4 firms: ~80% market) |
| Higher Ed Textbooks | Same Big 4 | Oligopoly |
| College Admissions Testing | College Board (SAT), ACT Inc. | Duopoly |
| State Assessment | Pearson, ETS, AIR, Cambium | Oligopoly |
| For-Profit Higher Ed | University of Phoenix, Southern NH, Grand Canyon | Concentrated but declining |
| Online Program Management | 2U, Coursera, Noodle | Consolidating |
| K-12 Virtual | Stride Inc. | Near-monopoly in full-time virtual K-12 |

### Major Players

**Public Systems (by enrollment)**

| Rank | System | Enrollment | Type |
|------|--------|-----------|------|
| 1 | California Community Colleges | 1.8 million | Public 2-year |
| 2 | CUNY | 275,000 | Public 4-year |
| 3 | SUNY | 400,000 | Public 4-year |
| 4 | Texas A&M System | 175,000 | Public 4-year |
| 5 | University of California | 285,000 | Public 4-year |

**Commercial Education Companies (by revenue)**

| Rank | Company | Revenue | Business |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Pearson | $4.7B | Publishing, testing, online learning |
| 2 | McGraw-Hill | $1.8B | Publishing, digital platforms |
| 3 | Chegg | $800M | Homework help, textbook rental |
| 4 | Stride Inc. | $1.9B | K-12 virtual schools |
| 5 | 2U | $950M | Online program management |
| 6 | Grand Canyon Education | $900M | OPM for Grand Canyon University |
| 7 | Coursera | $600M | Online courses, degrees |

### Competitive Dynamics

In public education, competition occurs primarily through residential sorting (families choose schools by choosing neighborhoods) and through school choice programs (charters, vouchers, open enrollment). Roughly 10% of public school students attend charter schools; charter market share exceeds 50% in some urban districts (New Orleans, Detroit, DC).

In commercial education, competition is fierce for government contracts (state assessments, curriculum adoptions) and for student enrollment (for-profit colleges, online programs). Regulatory risk is high: for-profit colleges face periodic crackdowns on predatory practices; ed-tech companies face privacy scrutiny.

In higher education, elite institutions compete for prestige (rankings, research funding, star faculty). Community colleges and regional universities compete for local enrollment. Online programs compete nationally for working adults.

## Geographic Distribution

### Regional Patterns

**K-12 Spending Variation**

Per-pupil spending varies dramatically by state:

| Highest Spending | Per Pupil | Lowest Spending | Per Pupil |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| New York | $29,000 | Utah | $9,000 |
| New Jersey | $23,000 | Idaho | $9,500 |
| Vermont | $22,000 | Arizona | $10,000 |
| Connecticut | $21,000 | Oklahoma | $10,500 |
| Massachusetts | $19,000 | Mississippi | $10,500 |

These gaps reflect: property wealth, political preferences, cost of living, and school finance litigation history. Court decisions in many states (beginning with *Serrano v. Priest* in California, 1971) forced equalization, but substantial interstate inequality remains.

**Charter School Concentration**

Charter schools cluster in urban areas and in states with permissive charter laws:

| State | Charter Enrollment Share | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------|-------|
| Arizona | 18% | Most permissive charter law |
| Colorado | 14% | Strong authorization system |
| California | 11% | Large absolute numbers |
| Florida | 11% | Recent rapid growth |
| Michigan | 10% | Detroit ~55% charter |

Rural states (Montana, West Virginia, Nebraska) have minimal charter presence. Charter schools are rare in the Northeast except in cities.

**Higher Education Geography**

Higher education is more geographically concentrated than K-12:

- **Research universities**: Cluster in metros with strong knowledge economies (Boston, Bay Area, Research Triangle, Ann Arbor, Austin)
- **College towns**: University dominates local economy (State College PA, Champaign-Urbana, Madison, Boulder, Athens GA)
- **Community colleges**: Distributed roughly proportional to population
- **For-profit schools**: Concentrated in Sunbelt metros with large working-adult populations (Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami)

The geography of higher education shapes regional economies. Universities anchor innovation ecosystems; student spending supports college-town retail; alumni networks facilitate hiring. The absence of a major research university can limit a region's economic development options.

## The Workforce

### Employment Overview

Education employs roughly 13 million workers---about 8% of total employment:

| Segment | Employment | Avg Wage |
|---------|------------|----------|
| K-12 Teachers | 3.7 million | $65,000 |
| K-12 Support Staff | 2.5 million | $35,000 |
| K-12 Administrators | 500,000 | $100,000 |
| Higher Ed Faculty | 1.5 million | $80,000 (varies enormously) |
| Higher Ed Staff | 2.5 million | $50,000 |
| Private Education | 1.5 million | $45,000 |
| Education Services | 800,000 | $60,000 |

### The Teacher Labor Market

Teaching is the largest single occupation in the United States. The teacher labor market has several distinctive features:

**Wage compression**: Teacher salaries vary less than in other professions. A stellar teacher earns perhaps 20% more than a mediocre colleague; in the private sector, the ratio might be 2:1 or 3:1. This reflects union contracts, public sector pay scales, and difficulty measuring teacher productivity.

**Experience premium**: Teachers receive substantial raises for experience (especially in the first 10 years) and for additional credentials (master's degrees). Whether these credentials improve teaching is disputed---the evidence is weak---but the pay incentives persist.

**Geographic immobility**: Teachers accumulate pension benefits in state-specific systems, creating substantial costs to interstate mobility. A teacher who moves after 15 years may forfeit hundreds of thousands in retirement benefits.

**Shortages**: Teacher shortages are persistent in certain areas:
- Subjects: Math, science, special education, bilingual
- Locations: Rural areas, high-poverty urban schools
- Overall: Fewer students entering teaching programs since 2010

Research on teacher quality finds enormous variation in effectiveness. Replacing a bottom-5% teacher with an average teacher raises students' lifetime earnings by ~$250,000 per classroom (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2014). Yet identifying effective teachers *before* hiring remains difficult; credentials and test scores are weak predictors.

### Higher Education Faculty

The higher education labor market has bifurcated:

**Tenure-track faculty** (~30% of instructional staff): Secure positions, high salaries, research time, shared governance. Median salary ~$100,000; top researchers earn $200,000+.

**Contingent faculty** (~70% of instructional staff):
- Adjunct instructors: Paid per course ($3,000-5,000 per class), no benefits, no job security
- Full-time non-tenure-track: Better paid but still precarious
- Graduate students: Provide instruction while training

This casualization of academic labor has accelerated since the 1990s. Universities save money and maintain flexibility; faculty bear the risk. Adjuncts at multiple institutions may earn $25,000-40,000 for full-time teaching loads.

### Administrative Growth

Education administration has expanded faster than instruction:

- K-12: Administrators grew 88% from 1992-2019; teachers grew 60%; enrollment grew 19%
- Higher Ed: Administrative positions grew 60% from 1993-2009; faculty grew 10%

This "administrative bloat" reflects regulatory compliance (special education, Title IX, accreditation), student services expansion, and revenue-generating activities (fundraising, athletics, research administration). Critics argue it raises costs without improving instruction.

## Regulation and Policy

### K-12 Governance

Education governance in America is radically decentralized:

**Federal**: Department of Education provides ~8% of K-12 funding with conditions attached. Major laws:
- Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965, reauthorized as Every Student Succeeds Act 2015): Title I funding for low-income schools
- Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1975): Requires free appropriate public education for disabled students
- No Child Left Behind (2002, replaced by ESSA): Mandated testing and accountability

**State**: Constitutional responsibility for education. State boards of education set standards, approve curricula, license teachers, authorize charters, distribute state aid.

**Local**: ~13,000 school districts governed by elected or appointed boards. Districts hire superintendents, negotiate contracts, build schools, and make most operational decisions.

### Higher Education Regulation

Higher education operates in a different regulatory environment:

**Accreditation**: Regional accreditors (e.g., Higher Learning Commission, SACSCOC) serve as gatekeepers for federal aid eligibility. Accreditation is peer-review based and controversial---critics argue it protects incumbents and impedes innovation.

**Federal Aid Conditions**: Institutions accepting federal financial aid must comply with:
- Title IX (gender equity)
- Clery Act (campus safety reporting)
- Gainful employment rules (for vocational programs)
- 90/10 rule (for-profit revenue limits)

**State Authorization**: Each state licenses institutions to operate within its borders. Online education has complicated this---Arizona-based universities must be authorized in 50 states.

### Policy Debates

Current debates include:

- **School choice**: Whether to expand charters, vouchers, and education savings accounts
- **College affordability**: Free college proposals, student debt forgiveness, income-driven repayment
- **Accountability**: How to measure school and teacher performance
- **Curriculum**: Debates over "critical race theory," sex education, and school library content
- **For-profit regulation**: Whether and how to regulate predatory for-profit colleges

## Trade Associations and Lobbying

Education is heavily lobbied from all directions:

### Major Trade Associations

| Association | Members | Focus |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| National Education Association (NEA) | 3 million teachers | Teacher interests, public education funding |
| American Federation of Teachers (AFT) | 1.7 million | Teachers, support staff, higher ed |
| American Association of State Colleges and Universities | 400 institutions | State university interests |
| Association of American Universities | 69 research universities | Research funding, graduate education |
| National School Boards Association | ~14,000 districts | Local governance, federal policy |
| National Alliance for Public Charter Schools | Charter sector | Charter expansion, funding equity |
| American Council on Education | 1,700 institutions | Higher education policy |
| Association of Community College Trustees | 6,500 trustees | Community college interests |

### Lobbying Activity

Education lobbying is substantial:

**Teacher unions** (NEA, AFT): Among the largest political spenders. Primarily Democratic-aligned. Focus: compensation, class size, opposing vouchers and merit pay.

**For-profit colleges**: Heavy lobbying against regulatory restrictions. Career Education Colleges and Universities (CECU) represents the sector.

**Testing companies and publishers**: Lobby for testing mandates and procurement opportunities.

**Higher education**: Universities lobby for research funding, student aid, and regulatory flexibility. Elite universities defend tax-exempt endowments.

Political economy dynamics: Teacher unions oppose many reforms (charters, vouchers, evaluation) that threaten member jobs or working conditions. School choice advocates (supported by conservative foundations and some tech billionaires) push for competition. Higher education lobbies for subsidies while resisting accountability.

## Returns to Education

Despite its complexity, the American education system delivers substantial economic returns---at least on average.

### The College Premium

College graduates earn dramatically more than high school graduates:

- **College wage premium**: ~80% (college grads earn 80% more than high school grads)
- **Lifetime earnings gap**: $1-1.5 million higher for bachelor's degree holders
- **Premium has grown**: From ~40% in 1980 to ~80% today

This growth reflects technological change favoring cognitive skills and stagnant demand for routine labor.

### Causal Estimates

How much of this gap reflects the causal effect of education (skills gained) versus selection (higher-ability people attend college)?

Careful studies using instrumental variables and natural experiments find:
- **7-10% wage increase per year of schooling**---substantial but somewhat below naive estimates
- **Effects are real, not just signaling**: Compulsory schooling laws, school construction, draft avoidance all show genuine productivity effects

The Mincer equation remains the workhorse model:

$$
\ln W_i = \alpha + \beta S_i + \gamma_1 X_i + \gamma_2 X_i^2 + \varepsilon_i
$$

where $W$ is wages, $S$ is schooling, $X$ is experience. Typical estimates: $\beta \approx 0.08-0.12$.

### Returns Vary

Returns to education differ by:
- **Level**: Highest returns in developing countries for primary school; in the US, highest for college
- **Field**: STEM majors earn 50-100% more than humanities at mid-career
- **Institution**: Selective college attendance raises earnings modestly (5-15%), with larger effects for disadvantaged students
- **Completion**: Dropouts earn little more than high school graduates while accumulating debt

## Recent Trends

### 1. The For-Profit Collapse and Online Pivot

For-profit higher education boomed in the 2000s, enrolling 2+ million students by 2010. Then came collapse: Obama-era regulations, lawsuits, and bad publicity crushed enrollment. University of Phoenix fell from 460,000 students (2010) to under 100,000 (2023). ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges closed entirely.

But online education didn't die---it migrated to nonprofits. Southern New Hampshire University (nonprofit) grew from 3,000 to 200,000 students. Traditional universities partnered with "OPMs" (Online Program Managers) to launch online degrees. The line between nonprofit and for-profit blurred.

### 2. The Testing Wars

Standardized testing faces unprecedented challenges:
- **Test-optional admissions**: Post-COVID, many colleges dropped SAT/ACT requirements; some made the change permanent
- **State testing backlash**: "Opt-out" movements; criticism of teaching to the test
- **Alternative credentials**: Skills-based hiring, microcredentials, badges challenging degree monopoly

Yet testing remains entrenched: state accountability laws mandate it; the College Board and ACT adapt and persist.

### 3. The Enrollment Cliff

Demographics are about to reshape higher education:

- Birth rates fell during and after 2008-09 recession
- The "enrollment cliff" arrives ~2025: 15% fewer high school graduates
- Impact will concentrate on small private colleges and regional publics
- Elite institutions and community colleges relatively insulated

Predictions: 500-1,000 college closures or mergers in the next 15 years.

### 4. AI and the Future of Instruction

ChatGPT's arrival (2022) created immediate disruption:
- **Cheating**: Traditional homework and essays easily automated
- **Tutoring**: AI tutors (Khan Academy's Khanmigo) promise personalized instruction at scale
- **Assessment**: Shift toward in-class, supervised evaluation
- **Teaching**: Potential to automate routine instruction; human teachers focus on facilitation

The magnitude of AI disruption remains uncertain. If AI tutoring replicates human tutoring effects (0.4 SD), it could transform education equity. Or it could become another oversold ed-tech fad.

### 5. Geographic Polarization

Education has become politically polarized along geographic lines:
- **Rural/suburban red states**: School choice expansion, curriculum restrictions, homeschool growth
- **Urban/blue states**: Defend traditional public schools, expand early childhood, resist charters
- **Sorting**: Families choose communities partly based on school politics

This polarization complicates national policy and may increase interstate variation.

## Firm Profiles

### College Board

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: New York, NY
> - Founded: 1900
> - Revenue: ~$1.5 billion
> - Employees: ~6,000
> - Status: Nonprofit

The College Board is the most powerful organization in American education that most Americans have never thought about. It administers the SAT (2+ million test-takers annually), the PSAT (3.5 million), and Advanced Placement exams (5 million). It owns the CSS Profile used for financial aid at selective colleges.

The organization's nonprofit status belies its market power. There is no alternative to AP exams---a student who wants college credit for AP Biology must take the College Board's test. The SAT faces only one competitor (ACT); together they long held a duopoly on college admissions testing.

The College Board has faced criticism for: high test fees ($60 per AP exam, $60 for SAT), selling student data to colleges, and scoring delays. The test-optional movement threatens its SAT business, though AP remains strong.

CEO David Coleman (since 2012) previously led development of the Common Core standards, making him one of the most influential figures in American education---all from a position outside government.

### Pearson

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: London, UK (major US operations)
> - Founded: 1844 (education focus since 1998)
> - Revenue: $4.7 billion
> - Employees: ~20,000
> - Stock: LSE: PSON

Pearson is the world's largest education company, touching almost every segment of American education:
- **Testing**: Contracts for state assessments in numerous states; GED testing; NCLEX (nursing); professional certifications
- **Higher Ed**: Major textbook publisher; owns Pearson+, digital platform with 4 million subscribers
- **Online Learning**: Pearson Online Learning Services; virtual schools
- **English Learning**: Largest provider of English language instruction globally

Pearson exemplifies the commercial penetration of public education. A single company may provide a state's curriculum, assessments, teacher training, and remediation materials---controlling the entire "value chain" of accountability.

The company has struggled financially as digital disruption hits textbooks. Revenue has declined from $8 billion (2014) to under $5 billion. Pearson has pivoted toward "direct-to-consumer" subscription models and workforce credentials.

Critics accuse Pearson of prioritizing profit over quality, citing testing errors and aggressive sales tactics. Supporters note that scale enables sophisticated assessment development smaller players cannot match.

### University of California System

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Oakland, CA
> - Founded: 1868
> - Budget: ~$45 billion (system-wide, including medical centers)
> - Students: ~285,000 (10 campuses)
> - Faculty: ~24,000
> - Status: Public

The University of California is the crown jewel of American public higher education---and a case study in the tensions facing elite public universities.

The system includes five top-50 research universities (Berkeley, UCLA, San Diego, Davis, Santa Barbara) and three national laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos). UC faculty have won 71 Nobel Prizes.

UC pioneered the "California Master Plan" (1960), which stratified higher education: UC for the top 12.5% of high school graduates, Cal State for the top third, community colleges open to all. This system provided both excellence and access---though it has frayed as state funding declined.

The UC model is under strain:
- **State funding collapsed**: From 78% of core funding (1990) to ~40% (2023)
- **Tuition rose**: From essentially free (1960s) to $14,000 in-state, $44,000 out-of-state
- **Out-of-state enrollment**: UC campuses admit more non-resident students (who pay full freight), angering California families
- **Housing crisis**: California's housing costs make UC campuses unaffordable for many students

UC remains a remarkable institution---world-class research combined with genuine socioeconomic diversity (40%+ of undergrads are Pell-eligible). But its future depends on political will to fund public higher education.
