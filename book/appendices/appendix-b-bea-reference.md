## How to Read BEA Industry Tables

### Value Added vs. Gross Output

- **Value added** (GDP): The contribution to final output. Value added = Gross output minus intermediate inputs. This is what appears in the GDP tables.

- **Gross output**: Total production, including intermediate goods. Gross output counts all sales, including business-to-business transactions.

Example: A steel mill sells $100 million in steel to an auto plant. The auto plant uses that steel to make cars worth $200 million.
- Gross output: $300 million ($100M steel + $200M cars)
- Value added: $200 million (only the final product counts)

### Real vs. Nominal

- **Nominal** (current dollars): Values at prices of the measurement year
- **Real** (constant/chained dollars): Values adjusted for inflation, typically using 2017 as base year

Use real values for growth comparisons over time; nominal for current-period analysis.

### Industry Classification

BEA uses NAICS (North American Industry Classification System). Key features:
- Two-digit codes: Broad sectors (e.g., 31-33 = Manufacturing)
- Three-digit codes: Subsectors (e.g., 334 = Computer and electronic products)
- Four-digit codes: Industry groups
- Five/six-digit codes: Detailed industries

NAICS is revised every five years. Historical comparisons may require concordance tables when industry definitions change.

## Input-Output Tables

BEA produces input-output tables showing inter-industry purchases. Two main types:

**Use Table**: Shows which industries purchase which commodities
- Rows: Commodities (products)
- Columns: Industries (producers)

**Make Table**: Shows which industries produce which commodities
- Rows: Industries
- Columns: Commodities

The symmetric industry-by-industry table (derived from Use and Make tables) shows direct purchases between industries.

### Reading the I-O Tables

A cell showing $50 billion at the intersection of "Automotive" row and "Steel" column means the automotive industry purchased $50 billion worth of steel products.

### Multipliers

BEA calculates economic multipliers showing total impact (direct + indirect + induced) of changes in final demand. Type I multipliers capture direct and indirect effects; Type II adds induced effects from household spending.

## Data Vintage Notes

BEA revises data through a predictable schedule:
- GDP: Three monthly estimates (advance, second, third), then annual and comprehensive revisions
- Industry accounts: Annual revisions, quinquennial benchmark revisions
- Regional accounts: Quarterly for states, annual for metros

Always note the vintage of data used in analysis. Current estimates may differ from figures cited in this book.
