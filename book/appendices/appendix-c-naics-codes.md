## NAICS vs. SIC

NAICS replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system in 1997. Key differences:

- **Service sector detail**: NAICS provides much more detailed service industry classification
- **Information sector**: NAICS created a dedicated Information sector (51) that did not exist in SIC
- **Production-based**: NAICS classifies by production process; SIC was more product-oriented
- **North American coverage**: NAICS is harmonized with Canada and Mexico; SIC was U.S.-only

Historical data before 1997 uses SIC codes. Concordance tables are available from Census Bureau for converting between systems.

## NAICS Revisions

NAICS is revised every five years (2007, 2012, 2017, 2022). Major recent changes:

**2022 Revision**:
- New industries for renewable electricity generation (wind, solar, geothermal)
- Expanded detail for cannabis industry
- New industries for online retailers
- Updated data processing and hosting categories

When comparing data across time, check whether NAICS codes remained consistent or whether industries were reclassified.

## Using NAICS for Research

### Data Sources by NAICS

| Source | Geographic Detail | Time Frequency |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| BEA GDP by Industry | National | Annual |
| BEA Regional | State, Metro | Annual |
| BLS QCEW | County | Quarterly |
| BLS OES | Metro, State | Annual |
| Census CBP | County | Annual |
| Census Economic Census | County | 5-year |

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Holding companies**: Large conglomerates may be classified in NAICS 55 (Management) rather than their operating industries

2. **Auxiliary establishments**: Corporate headquarters may be classified separately from operating facilities

3. **Primary activity**: Establishments are classified by primary activity; secondary activities are not captured

4. **Suppression**: Data for small cells may be suppressed to protect confidentiality

5. **Revisions**: Be aware of when NAICS definitions changed for any longitudinal analysis
