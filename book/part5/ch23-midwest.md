# 23. The Midwest

Drive west from Pittsburgh and the landscape tells a story of industrial might and industrial decline. Steel mills, now mostly silent, line the rivers. Factory towns bear names like Youngstown, Akron, Flint---places that once defined American manufacturing and now struggle to define their futures. But continue west to Columbus, Indianapolis, or Minneapolis, and the story changes. Cranes dot skylines. New factories rise. The Midwest is reinventing itself.

## The Industrial Heartland

The Midwest---here defined as the Great Lakes states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota---remains America's manufacturing core. Despite decades of job losses, the region produces more industrial output than ever. The paradox is productivity: the same volume of goods requires far fewer workers.

**Regional Economic Overview (2024)**

| State | GDP | Manufacturing Share | Population Trend |
|-------|-----|---------------------|------------------|
| Illinois | $1.05 trillion | 11% | Stable/declining |
| Ohio | $800 billion | 16% | Stable |
| Michigan | $620 billion | 20% | Stable |
| Indiana | $450 billion | 28% | Growing |
| Minnesota | $440 billion | 12% | Growing |
| Wisconsin | $400 billion | 18% | Stable |

The region's challenge is structural: manufacturing output grows through automation while manufacturing employment shrinks. Ohio ranks third nationally in manufacturing jobs (687,000), but that figure has fallen by half since 1979.

## Metropolitan Economies

### Chicago: The Midwest's Global City

Chicago stands apart from its regional neighbors. With a GDP of $886 billion, it is the only Midwestern metropolitan area with true global status---a world financial center, transportation hub, and corporate headquarters cluster that competes directly with New York and Los Angeles.

**Economic Pillars:**

**Finance and Trading:** The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) and Cboe Global Markets make Chicago the world capital of derivatives trading. Futures and options contracts for agriculture, currencies, interest rates, and equity indices trade here first. The city's financial technology sector builds on this foundation.

**Transportation and Logistics:** Every major railroad crosses Chicago. The city handles more freight than any metropolitan area in the country. O'Hare Airport ranks among the world's busiest. The I-80/I-55 corridor has become a vast logistics zone, with warehouses stretching across the exurbs serving the entire Midwest.

**Corporate Headquarters:** McDonald's, Boeing (until 2022), United Airlines, Abbott Laboratories, Caterpillar (until 2022), Walgreens, Kraft Heinz---Chicago has historically concentrated Fortune 500 headquarters. Recent departures to Texas have raised concerns about the city's business environment.

**Universities:** The University of Chicago and Northwestern produce research and talent that feed the metropolitan economy. The Illinois Medical District anchors healthcare employment.

Chicago's core challenge is population loss: the metro area has declined slightly since 2010, driven by domestic out-migration that international immigration only partially offsets. Illinois's fiscal challenges, high property taxes, and cold winters make the cost-benefit calculation increasingly unfavorable for mobile professionals.

### Detroit: Reinventing Mobility

Detroit's identity remains inseparable from automobiles, but the content of that identity is transforming. The region that perfected the internal combustion engine is now betting on electric vehicles.

**Key Statistics:**
- Metropolitan GDP: $280 billion
- Automotive employment: 200,000+
- Major employers: Ford, General Motors, Stellantis

General Motors' Factory ZERO in Hamtramck, Ford's investments in Michigan, and the battery plants clustering nearby represent tens of billions in capital expenditure. The goal is to make Michigan the center of EV manufacturing just as it was the center of gasoline vehicles.

But the workforce implications are disruptive. Electric vehicles require fewer workers to assemble---no transmissions, fewer parts, simpler systems. The United Auto Workers' 2023 strike targeted exactly this transition: how to protect jobs and wages as the technology changes.

Detroit's broader metropolitan economy has diversified around healthcare (Henry Ford Health, Beaumont) and technology (a small but growing startup scene around mobility and automation). But the city proper remains troubled: population has fallen by 60% since 1950, and large swaths of former residential neighborhoods have been demolished.

### Minneapolis-St. Paul: The Corporate Fortress

The Twin Cities present an anomaly: a metropolitan area of 3.7 million people in the upper Midwest with an extraordinary concentration of corporate headquarters. Target, UnitedHealth Group, 3M, General Mills, Best Buy, U.S. Bank---the Fortune 500 density per capita rivals New York.

**Key Statistics:**
- Metropolitan GDP: $280 billion
- Fortune 500 headquarters: 17
- Major sectors: Retail, healthcare, manufacturing

This "corporate fortress" provides unusual economic stability. The headquarters economy generates high-wage jobs in management, finance, and professional services. The companies' historical commitment to their hometown---unusual in an era of corporate mobility---has sustained civic institutions and philanthropic activity.

The Twin Cities also lead in healthcare and medical device manufacturing. Medtronic, the world's largest medical device company, is headquartered in the suburbs. The Mayo Clinic lies 90 minutes south in Rochester.

### Columbus: The Silicon Heartland

Columbus is the Rust Belt's growth story. While Cleveland and Detroit lost population, Columbus grew faster than almost any metropolitan area in the region.

**Key Statistics:**
- Metropolitan GDP: $170 billion
- Population growth 2010-2024: 18%
- Key development: Intel chip fabs ($20 billion investment)

The city benefits from Ohio State University's 67,000 students, a young demographic profile, and relative affordability. But Intel's decision to build two massive chip fabrication plants in suburban Licking County has transformed Columbus's trajectory. Though initial timelines targeting 2025 have slipped---production is now expected to ramp up later in the decade---the construction and supplier clustering are already reshaping the regional economy.

The "Silicon Heartland" branding reflects broader ambition: federal CHIPS Act funding has directed billions toward Ohio, and a cluster of suppliers, research centers, and related industries is forming around the Intel anchors.

### Cleveland and Pittsburgh: Eds and Meds

Cleveland and Pittsburgh represent the most successful version of post-industrial reinvention: the "eds and meds" model, where research universities and teaching hospitals replace factories as economic anchors.

**Cleveland:** The Cleveland Clinic is now the region's largest employer, having grown into a globally recognized healthcare system. Its research in cardiac care and various medical specialties attracts patients worldwide. Case Western Reserve University and the surrounding University Circle form a cultural and research district.

**Pittsburgh:** Carnegie Mellon University's robotics and artificial intelligence programs have made Pittsburgh a genuine technology center. Self-driving vehicle companies (Uber's advanced research, Aurora, Argo AI before its closure) chose Pittsburgh specifically for CMU access. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) employs over 90,000 people across Western Pennsylvania.

Both cities have stabilized after decades of decline, though neither has returned to population growth. The healthcare and education sectors provide employment floors that manufacturing once provided---but they require different skills and pay different wages.

### Indianapolis: Crossroads and Life Sciences

Indianapolis's identity as "the crossroads of America" reflects its location at the intersection of major interstates. FedEx operates a major hub there; logistics companies have clustered to serve the national market from a central location.

**Key Statistics:**
- Metropolitan GDP: $180 billion
- Life sciences employment: 75,000+
- Flagship: Eli Lilly (headquartered in Indianapolis)

Eli Lilly, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, anchors an extensive life sciences cluster. Roche Diagnostics, Anthem (now Elevance Health), and numerous medical device companies employ tens of thousands in the region. Indiana University's medical school and research facilities feed this ecosystem.

The city's moderate costs---substantially below Chicago, Columbus, or the Twin Cities---provide competitive advantage for employers seeking Midwest location without Midwest's highest expenses.

## The Manufacturing Revival

The "Rust Belt to recovery" narrative has shifted from hope to reality---at least in selected locations. Federal industrial policy has directed enormous investment into the region.

**Major Industrial Policy Investments:**

| Company | Location | Investment | Product |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| Intel | Columbus, OH | $20 billion | Semiconductor fabs |
| Honda/LG | Fayette County, OH | $3.5 billion | EV battery plant |
| Ford | Marshall, MI | $3.5 billion | Battery plant |
| Samsung SDI/Stellantis | Kokomo, IN | $3.1 billion | EV batteries |
| Gotion | Big Rapids, MI | $2.3 billion | EV batteries |

Combined with state incentives, the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act have funneled over $50 billion in clean energy and semiconductor investments into the region since 2022.

This represents genuine re-industrialization---but of a different character than the old manufacturing. The new factories are heavily automated, requiring chemical engineers and robotics technicians rather than assembly line workers. Employment per dollar of output is far lower than at the plants these investments replace.

### The Battery Belt

A new industrial corridor is forming: the "Battery Belt" running from Michigan through Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. Every major automaker is building EV battery capacity in this corridor, attracted by existing supply chains, workforce skills, and proximity to vehicle assembly plants.

The corridor represents a strategic bet: that electrification will revitalize Midwestern manufacturing rather than destroy it. The UAW's concern is that battery plants employ fewer workers than engine plants, and many are joint ventures with Korean battery makers less accommodating of union organizing.

## The Farm Economy

The Midwest's agricultural economy remains globally significant---the "Corn Belt" produces the feedstocks for American food and fuel---but it has become economically marginal for rural communities.

**2025 Agricultural Outlook:**
- Net farm income: Projected to rebound 37-40% from 2024 lows
- Driver of recovery: Livestock (cattle, poultry) and government payments
- Challenge: Row crops (corn, soybeans) face low prices and high costs

The region illustrates agriculture's productivity paradox: output reaches record levels while the farm population continues to decline. Fewer, larger farms operated by fewer workers produce more than ever before. The result is that small towns and rural counties throughout the Corn Belt continue losing population even as their agricultural output grows.

## Demographics and Talent

The Midwest's demographic trajectory presents its greatest long-term challenge. The region is aging; young people continue leaving for the coasts and the Sunbelt; without international immigration, populations would decline outright.

**Net Domestic Migration (2020-2024)**

| State | Net Migration |
|-------|---------------|
| Illinois | -340,000 |
| Michigan | -80,000 |
| Ohio | -50,000 |
| Minnesota | -40,000 |
| Indiana | +25,000 |
| Wisconsin | -30,000 |

International immigration offsets much of this loss, but the "brain drain" of college-educated professionals remains acute. Graduates of the region's excellent universities---Michigan, Ohio State, Northwestern, Wisconsin---frequently relocate to Chicago, the coasts, or the Sunbelt upon graduation.

**Exceptions:** Columbus, Indianapolis, and Madison (Wisconsin) have succeeded in retaining young professionals, offering the combination of urban amenities, moderate costs, and job opportunities that attracts graduates. Wisconsin has shown improved talent retention in recent years through aggressive efforts to keep state university graduates.

## Regional Profiles

### CME Group

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Chicago, IL
> - Revenue: $5.6 billion (2024)
> - Employees: 4,300
> - Daily trading volume: $13 billion in notional value

CME Group, formed from the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, is the world's largest derivatives exchange. Futures and options on interest rates, stock indices, currencies, energy, metals, and agricultural commodities trade on its platforms.

The company's origins trace to the 19th-century grain markets---farmers and merchants seeking to manage price risk created standardized futures contracts. That innovation became the foundation for modern financial risk management.

Today, CME Group operates electronically, but Chicago remains its headquarters and its regulatory domicile. The concentration of trading expertise, clearinghouse operations, and financial talent keeps the derivatives industry rooted in the Midwest even as other financial activities have dispersed.

### Cleveland Clinic

> **Quick Facts**
> - Headquarters: Cleveland, OH
> - Revenue: $14.8 billion (2024)
> - Employees: 77,000
> - Patients (annual): 12 million+ visits

Cleveland Clinic exemplifies the transformation of Rust Belt cities into healthcare centers. Founded in 1921, the clinic has grown into one of the world's most prestigious medical institutions, consistently ranked among America's top hospitals.

The organization has become Cleveland's economic anchor. Its main campus employs tens of thousands; its purchasing power supports local suppliers; its construction projects provide years of work. Medical tourism---patients traveling from across the country and around the world for specialized care---brings outside money into the regional economy.

The model has limits: healthcare employment doesn't scale the way manufacturing once did, and the jobs cluster at the extremes of the wage distribution (physicians and executives at the top, service workers at the bottom). But for Cleveland, the clinic provides economic stability that the steel industry no longer can.

### Intel (Ohio Fabs)

> **Quick Facts**
> - Parent company: Intel Corporation (Santa Clara, CA)
> - Ohio investment: $20 billion (phase one)
> - Location: Licking County, near Columbus
> - Projected employment: 3,000 direct, 10,000+ construction

Intel's Ohio project represents the largest single private investment in the state's history. Two chip fabrication plants, with potential expansion to eight, will produce advanced semiconductors using Intel's latest manufacturing processes.

The project is industrial policy in action. The CHIPS Act provides billions in subsidies; Ohio contributed $2 billion in incentives. The goal is strategic: reduce American dependence on Taiwanese chip production and establish domestic capability for the most advanced semiconductors.

For Ohio, the investment anchors broader ambitions. The state is recruiting semiconductor suppliers, research centers, and related businesses. Ohio State University is expanding engineering programs. A semiconductor cluster is forming that could define the regional economy for decades---much as automobiles once defined Detroit.
