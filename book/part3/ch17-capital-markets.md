# Chapter 17: Capital Markets

Every day, $1.5 trillion changes hands on American stock exchanges alone. Add in bonds, derivatives, and private markets, and you have a capital allocation machine that dwarfs the rest of the world combined: 42% of global stock market value, 55% of private equity, half of all venture capital. This dominance is not an accident. It is the product of specific institutions—exchanges, clearinghouses, broker-dealers, and regulators—that have evolved over two centuries to do one thing: match people with money to people who need it.

This chapter focuses on institutional structure rather than pricing theory—the practical plumbing of how capital gets allocated. We examine the stock exchanges where equities trade, the bond markets where governments and corporations borrow, the derivatives markets that enable risk transfer, and the private markets where venture capital and private equity operate.

## Size and Scope

American capital markets dwarf those of any other nation.

**Table 17.1: U.S. Capital Markets Overview (2023)**

| Market | Size | Global Share |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Stock market capitalization | $51 trillion | 42% |
| Treasury debt held by public | $26 trillion | — |
| Corporate bonds outstanding | $10 trillion | 39% |
| Municipal bonds outstanding | $4 trillion | — |
| Mortgage-backed securities | $12 trillion | — |
| Listed derivatives (notional) | $95 trillion | 33% |
| Private equity AUM | $4.7 trillion | 55% |
| Venture capital AUM | $1.2 trillion | 50% |

The dominance is no accident. Deep capital markets require legal infrastructure (property rights, contract enforcement, bankruptcy procedures), sophisticated intermediaries, large pools of domestic savings, and network effects that attract foreign capital. The United States developed these advantages over more than a century, and they compound: liquidity attracts liquidity.

## Equity Markets

### The Major Exchanges

American stock trading is dominated by two exchange families, though the landscape is more fragmented than it appears.

**The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** remains the world's largest exchange by market capitalization of listed companies (roughly $28 trillion). Originally a specialist-based floor trading operation dating to 1792, the NYSE has evolved into a hybrid model combining electronic matching with designated market makers (DMMs) who provide liquidity for assigned stocks. The trading floor at 11 Wall Street, while largely ceremonial for routine trading, still handles complex orders and the opening/closing auctions.

The NYSE is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based exchange conglomerate that acquired NYSE Euronext in 2013 for $8.2 billion. ICE also owns ICE Futures (commodities and financial futures), ICE Clear (clearinghouses), and a data services business.

**NASDAQ** began in 1971 as the first electronic stock market—the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system. Originally a quotation display system for over-the-counter stocks, it evolved into a full exchange and is now the second-largest globally by market capitalization (roughly $23 trillion). NASDAQ's all-electronic model and lower listing fees attracted technology companies, creating a self-reinforcing concentration: tech firms list on NASDAQ because other tech firms are there.

NASDAQ Inc. also owns NASDAQ Nordic/Baltic exchanges, The NASDAQ Options Market, and several data businesses. The company is headquartered in Times Square.

**Table 17.2: Major U.S. Stock Exchanges (2023)**

| Exchange | Market Cap Listed | Share Volume | Headquarters |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| NYSE | $28 trillion | 25% | New York |
| NASDAQ | $23 trillion | 32% | New York |
| CBOE | — | 17% | Chicago |
| IEX | — | 3% | New York |
| MEMX | — | 7% | New York |
| NYSE Arca | — | 10% | New York |

### Market Structure and Fragmentation

Stocks listed on NYSE or NASDAQ don't trade only on those exchanges. The National Market System (NMS) created by Regulation NMS (2005) allows any registered exchange or alternative trading system (ATS) to execute trades in any listed stock. This promotes competition but fragments liquidity across dozens of venues.

**Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs)** and dark pools handle significant volume. Dark pools—private trading venues that don't display quotes publicly—emerged to help institutional investors execute large orders without moving prices. Major dark pools include Credit Suisse Crossfinder, UBS MTF, and Goldman Sachs Sigma X. They handle roughly 15% of equity volume.

**Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)** has become central to retail trading economics. Retail brokers like Robinhood, Charles Schwab, and E*TRADE route customer orders to wholesale market makers—Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, and others—who pay for the order flow. The market makers profit from the spread between their buy and sell prices; the brokers profit from PFOF; retail investors get commission-free trades and often modest price improvement versus displayed quotes. Critics argue the system creates conflicts of interest; defenders note retail execution quality has improved.

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** firms now dominate market making. Citadel Securities handles roughly 27% of all U.S. equity volume. Virtu Financial, Jane Street, and Two Sigma are other major players. These firms use co-located servers (physically near exchange matching engines), sophisticated algorithms, and massive technology investment to capture tiny spreads across millions of trades. HFT has compressed bid-ask spreads but raised concerns about flash crashes and market stability.

### Market Indices

Stock indices serve as benchmarks for investment performance and as underlying assets for index funds and derivatives.

**The S&P 500**, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices (a subsidiary of S&P Global), tracks 500 large-cap U.S. stocks selected by committee. It's market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have more influence. The S&P 500 represents roughly 80% of U.S. market capitalization and has become the default benchmark for U.S. equity performance.

**The Dow Jones Industrial Average**, despite its fame, is a price-weighted index of only 30 stocks—an anachronistic methodology that gives higher-priced stocks more weight regardless of company size.

**NASDAQ Composite** includes all NASDAQ-listed stocks (over 3,000), creating a tech-heavy benchmark.

**Russell 2000** tracks small-cap stocks and is the standard benchmark for that segment.

Index composition matters enormously because roughly $15 trillion tracks the S&P 500 directly or in benchmarked strategies. When a stock enters or leaves the index, passive funds must buy or sell, creating predictable price movements that active traders exploit.

### IPOs and Capital Raising

The Initial Public Offering (IPO) process brings private companies to public markets. Investment banks underwrite IPOs, meaning they commit to buy shares from the issuing company and resell them to investors, bearing the risk of price declines.

The IPO process typically involves:

1. **Selecting underwriters**: Lead ("bookrunner") and co-managing banks
2. **Due diligence and SEC filing**: S-1 registration statement
3. **Roadshow**: Management presentations to institutional investors
4. **Book building**: Underwriters collect indications of interest
5. **Pricing**: Final offer price set the night before trading begins
6. **Allocation**: Shares distributed to institutional and retail investors
7. **First-day trading**: Stock begins trading on exchange

Underwriters typically receive 5-7% of gross proceeds as fees. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan dominate IPO underwriting, with boutiques handling smaller deals.

**Table 17.3: U.S. IPO Activity**

| Year | Number of IPOs | Gross Proceeds |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 2019 | 232 | $63 billion |
| 2020 | 480 | $168 billion |
| 2021 | 1,035 | $315 billion |
| 2022 | 181 | $22 billion |
| 2023 | 154 | $26 billion |

*Source: Renaissance Capital*

The IPO boom of 2020-2021 was fueled by low interest rates, pandemic stimulus, and the SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) phenomenon. SPACs—blank-check companies that raise money through IPO and then acquire private companies—offered an alternative path to public markets. After more than 600 SPAC IPOs in 2021, the market collapsed amid poor performance and regulatory scrutiny.

**Direct listings** allow companies to go public without raising new capital or using underwriters. Spotify and Coinbase used this approach. The NYSE and NASDAQ have both expanded rules to accommodate direct listings.

### Stock Buybacks and Capital Return

While IPOs channel capital *into* corporations, established companies increasingly return capital *to* shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases ("buybacks").

**Stock buybacks** allow companies to repurchase their own shares on the open market. When a company buys back stock, the shares are retired, reducing shares outstanding and increasing earnings per share (EPS) for remaining shareholders. Buybacks have become the dominant form of capital return, surpassing dividends for most large companies.

**Table 17.3a: S&P 500 Capital Return (billions)**

| Year | Buybacks | Dividends | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 2019 | $729 | $485 | $1,214 |
| 2020 | $520 | $480 | $1,000 |
| 2021 | $882 | $511 | $1,393 |
| 2022 | $923 | $565 | $1,488 |
| 2023 | $795 | $590 | $1,385 |

*Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices*

Why do companies prefer buybacks? Several reasons:

- **Tax efficiency**: Shareholders who don't sell pay no immediate tax; dividends are taxed when paid
- **Flexibility**: Unlike dividends (which markets expect to be maintained), buybacks can vary with cash flow
- **EPS management**: Reducing share count boosts EPS even without earnings growth
- **Executive compensation**: Stock-based pay benefits from higher share prices

Critics argue buybacks prioritize short-term stock prices over long-term investment. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 1% excise tax on buybacks, the first U.S. tax specifically targeting repurchases.

The scale of buybacks means many large corporations are net *withdrawers* of equity capital rather than net raisers—the opposite of the textbook function of equity markets. Apple alone has repurchased over $600 billion of stock since 2012.

### The Equity Premium Puzzle

A persistent finding in finance: stocks have historically returned far more than bonds, even after adjusting for risk. The "equity premium"—the excess return of stocks over Treasury bills—has averaged roughly 6% annually over the past century.

This premium is difficult to explain with standard economic models. Risk aversion would have to be implausibly high to justify avoiding stocks given historical returns. Various explanations have been proposed:

- **Rare disasters**: Investors fear extreme events (wars, pandemics) that could devastate equity values
- **Myopic loss aversion**: Investors evaluate portfolios too frequently and overweight short-term losses
- **Liquidity preferences**: Stocks are less liquid than they appear in a crisis
- **Habit formation**: Risk aversion varies with consumption relative to habit

The practical implication: long-term investors have historically been rewarded for bearing equity risk, even if theory can't fully explain why.

## Bond Markets

### Treasury Securities

The U.S. Treasury market is the world's largest, most liquid government bond market. Treasury securities are the benchmark "risk-free" rate against which all other debt is priced.

**Treasury securities come in several forms:**

| Type | Maturity | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| Treasury bills (T-bills) | 4, 8, 13, 26, 52 weeks | Zero-coupon (sold at discount) |
| Treasury notes | 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 years | Semi-annual coupon |
| Treasury bonds | 20, 30 years | Semi-annual coupon |
| TIPS | 5, 10, 30 years | Principal adjusts with CPI |
| FRNs | 2 years | Floating rate, tied to T-bill rate |

The Treasury Department issues securities through regular auctions. Primary dealers—currently 24 banks and broker-dealers—are required to bid at every auction and make markets in Treasury securities. Primary dealers include JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and foreign banks like BNP Paribas and Nomura.

**Who holds Treasury securities:**

| Holder | Amount | Share |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Federal Reserve | $4.7 trillion | 18% |
| Foreign official | $3.5 trillion | 13% |
| Foreign private | $3.8 trillion | 15% |
| Mutual funds | $3.2 trillion | 12% |
| Banks | $1.5 trillion | 6% |
| State/local governments | $1.1 trillion | 4% |
| Pension funds | $1.0 trillion | 4% |
| Other | $7.2 trillion | 28% |

*Source: Treasury Bulletin; figures approximate*

Foreign holdings of Treasury securities peaked around 35% and have declined as the Fed expanded its balance sheet. China and Japan remain the largest foreign holders, each with roughly $1 trillion.

### The Term Structure of Interest Rates

The yield curve—the relationship between bond yields and maturities—conveys information about expectations and risk.

Normally, longer-term bonds yield more than shorter-term bonds because:
1. **Expectations**: Future short rates may rise
2. **Term premium**: Investors require compensation for duration risk
3. **Liquidity preference**: Shorter bonds are generally more liquid

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The Yield Curve as Recession Indicator**

An inverted yield curve—when short-term rates exceed long-term rates—has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955. The 2022-2023 inversion was the deepest since the early 1980s.
{% endhint %}

The 2022-2023 inversion (2-year yields exceeding 10-year yields) sparked recession warnings, though the timing of subsequent downturns has historically varied from 6 to 24 months.

The **10-year Treasury yield** is the benchmark rate for the U.S. economy, influencing mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, and equity valuations. When 10-year yields rise, other rates follow, tightening financial conditions economy-wide.

### Corporate Bonds

<figure>

<figcaption>Figure 17.2: U.S. bond markets by segment. Treasury securities dominate, followed by mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. The $50+ trillion market dwarfs equities by outstanding value. Source: SIFMA</figcaption>
</figure>

Corporations borrow in bond markets to fund operations, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. The corporate bond market totals roughly $10 trillion outstanding.

**Investment grade bonds** (rated BBB- or higher by S&P) from established companies trade in liquid markets with tight spreads over Treasuries. Major issuers include Apple, Microsoft, JPMorgan, and other blue chips.

**High-yield bonds** (rated BB+ or lower), also called "junk bonds," offer higher coupons to compensate for default risk. The high-yield market developed in the 1980s, pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert's Michael Milken. Today, high-yield issuers include leveraged buyout targets, distressed companies, and growing firms without investment-grade ratings.

**Credit spreads**—the yield difference between corporate bonds and Treasuries—widen during economic stress and narrow during expansions. The ICE BofA High Yield Spread, tracking the average spread over Treasuries for high-yield bonds, ranges from roughly 300 basis points (3%) in good times to 1,000+ basis points (10%) during crises.

**Table 17.4: Corporate Bond Spreads (basis points over Treasuries)**

| Rating | Normal Spread | Crisis Spread (2008) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| AAA | 50-100 | 250 |
| A | 100-150 | 400 |
| BBB | 150-250 | 650 |
| BB | 300-400 | 1,200 |
| B | 500-600 | 2,000 |

*Source: SIFMA, US Bond Market Statistics, 2024*

Corporate bond issuance is underwritten by investment banks, similar to equity IPOs. Large issuers maintain relationships with multiple banks and can tap markets opportunistically when spreads are tight.

### Municipal Bonds

State and local governments issue municipal bonds to fund infrastructure, schools, and operations. The $4 trillion municipal market has a unique feature: interest income is generally exempt from federal income tax (and often state tax for in-state investors).

**General obligation (GO) bonds** are backed by the issuer's taxing power. **Revenue bonds** are backed by specific revenue streams (toll roads, airports, water systems).

The tax exemption means municipal yields are lower than taxable bonds—but the after-tax return can be higher for investors in high tax brackets. A "muni" yielding 3% is equivalent to a taxable bond yielding roughly 5% for an investor in the 40% combined tax bracket.

Credit quality varies widely. Most states maintain investment-grade ratings, but some municipalities have defaulted—most notably Detroit (2013) and Puerto Rico (2015-2022, the largest municipal bankruptcy).

The municipal market is less liquid than Treasury or corporate markets, with thousands of individual issuers and issues. Retail investors hold roughly 45% of municipal bonds, often through municipal bond funds.

## Derivatives Markets

Derivatives—contracts whose value derives from an underlying asset—enable risk transfer, hedging, and speculation. American derivatives markets are among the world's largest.

### Exchange-Traded Derivatives

**Futures contracts** obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Major U.S. futures exchanges:

- **CME Group** (Chicago): Owns CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX. Trades interest rate futures (SOFR, Treasury), equity index futures (S&P 500, NASDAQ), commodities (oil, gold, corn, cattle), and currencies. CME is the world's largest derivatives exchange by volume.

- **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**: Trades energy futures, agricultural products, equity index futures.

- **CBOE Global Markets** (Chicago): Dominates equity options, trades VIX futures, and operates stock exchanges.

**Table 17.5: Major U.S. Futures Contracts (2023)**

| Contract | Exchange | Notional Value/Day |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| E-mini S&P 500 | CME | $350 billion |
| 10-Year Treasury | CBOT | $250 billion |
| SOFR (3-month) | CME | $150 billion |
| Crude Oil (WTI) | NYMEX | $100 billion |
| E-mini NASDAQ 100 | CME | $120 billion |

*Note: SOFR futures replaced Eurodollar futures after LIBOR discontinuation in June 2023.*

*Source: World Federation of Exchanges, 2024*

**Options contracts** give the holder the right (not obligation) to buy or sell. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) pioneered listed equity options in 1973. Today, options volume exceeds underlying stock volume by several multiples as traders use options for leverage, hedging, and income generation.

The **VIX**—the CBOE Volatility Index—measures expected S&P 500 volatility derived from options prices. Called the "fear gauge," VIX spikes during market stress (hitting 80+ during March 2020) and falls during calm periods (below 15 in normal times).

### Over-the-Counter Derivatives

Most derivatives by notional value trade over-the-counter (OTC), negotiated bilaterally between parties rather than on exchanges.

**Interest rate swaps**—agreements to exchange fixed for floating interest payments—dominate OTC markets. Companies use swaps to manage interest rate exposure; banks use them to hedge loan portfolios. The interest rate swap market exceeds $500 trillion in notional value, though the actual economic exposure (reflecting netting) is far smaller.

**Credit default swaps (CDS)** provide insurance against default. The buyer pays periodic premiums; the seller pays out if the reference entity defaults. CDS played a central role in the 2008 crisis when AIG's enormous CDS positions threatened systemic collapse.

Post-2008 reforms pushed OTC derivatives toward central clearing. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated clearing through central counterparties (CCPs) for standardized swaps. LCH (owned by London Stock Exchange Group) and ICE Clear are major swap clearinghouses.

## Private Markets

### Private Equity

Private equity (PE) firms raise capital from institutional investors (pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds) and acquire companies—either taking public companies private or buying private companies—with the goal of improving operations and selling at a profit.

**The PE model:**
1. Raise a fund with committed capital from limited partners (LPs)
2. Identify acquisition targets
3. Acquire companies using significant debt (leveraged buyouts)
4. Improve operations over 3-7 years
5. Exit through sale or IPO
6. Return capital to LPs; collect 20% carried interest on profits

**Major PE firms:**

| Firm | AUM | Headquarters | Notable Deals |
|------|-----|--------------|---------------|
| Blackstone | $1.0 trillion | New York | Hilton, Refinitiv |
| KKR | $500 billion | New York | RJR Nabisco, First Data |
| Apollo | $600 billion | New York | ADT, Caesars |
| Carlyle | $400 billion | Washington, DC | Booz Allen, Hertz |
| TPG | $220 billion | San Francisco | Spotify, Airbnb |

Private equity now manages more assets than hedge funds. Supporters argue PE improves operational efficiency and provides patient capital for transformations. Critics note heavy debt loads can destabilize companies, workers often face layoffs, and the carried interest tax treatment (taxed as capital gains rather than ordinary income) represents an unjustified subsidy.

### Venture Capital

Venture capital (VC) funds early-stage companies with high growth potential in exchange for equity stakes. The VC ecosystem is concentrated in a few geographic clusters, particularly Silicon Valley.

**The VC model:**
1. Raise fund from LPs (endowments, foundations, wealthy individuals)
2. Make investments across a portfolio of startups
3. Provide mentorship, board seats, and follow-on funding
4. Hope that a few "home runs" more than offset losses on failed investments
5. Exit through IPO or acquisition

**Major VC firms:**

| Firm | Focus | Notable Investments | Location |
|------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| Sequoia Capital | Tech, healthcare | Apple, Google, Airbnb | Menlo Park |
| Andreessen Horowitz | Tech | Facebook, Coinbase, Instacart | Menlo Park |
| Accel | Tech | Dropbox, Spotify, Slack | Palo Alto |
| Kleiner Perkins | Tech, cleantech | Amazon, Google, Twitter | Menlo Park |
| Founders Fund | Tech | SpaceX, Palantir, Airbnb | San Francisco |

VC investment totaled $170 billion in 2021 (a record driven by zero interest rates) before falling to $67 billion in 2023 as monetary tightening reduced risk appetite.

**Table 17.6: U.S. Venture Capital Investment**

| Year | Deal Value | Deal Count |
|------|------------|------------|
| 2019 | $137 billion | 11,000 |
| 2020 | $164 billion | 12,000 |
| 2021 | $345 billion | 18,000 |
| 2022 | $238 billion | 15,000 |
| 2023 | $170 billion | 13,000 |

*Source: PitchBook*

The geographic concentration is striking: California accounted for 45% of VC deals and 50% of deal value in 2023. New York is second, followed by Massachusetts (Boston), Texas (Austin), and Washington (Seattle).

## The Geography of Capital Markets

Capital markets activity concentrates heavily in a few locations.

**New York City** dominates. Lower Manhattan houses NYSE and major bank headquarters. Midtown contains the offices of investment banks, asset managers, hedge funds, and PE firms. The New York Fed, located on Liberty Street, conducts monetary policy operations. Roughly 330,000 people work in financial services in New York City.

**Chicago** is the derivatives capital. CME Group, CBOE, and associated trading firms are headquartered there. The city's role dates to the 19th century grain trade; today it hosts the world's most important futures and options markets.

**Boston** has the largest concentration of mutual fund companies (Fidelity, State Street, MFS) outside New York, a legacy of the Massachusetts Investors Trust (1924), America's first mutual fund.

**Connecticut** (Greenwich and Stamford) houses major hedge funds, attracted by proximity to New York and favorable state tax treatment.

**San Francisco Bay Area** dominates venture capital, with Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park as the symbolic center.

**Charlotte** hosts major bank operations (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Truist) but relatively little capital markets activity.

**Table 17.7: Financial Services Employment by Metro (2023)**

| Metro Area | Finance Employment | Specialization |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| New York | 495,000 | Full-service |
| Chicago | 155,000 | Derivatives |
| Los Angeles | 140,000 | Entertainment finance |
| Boston | 130,000 | Asset management |
| San Francisco | 85,000 | VC, tech |
| Dallas | 120,000 | Regional banking |
| Charlotte | 80,000 | Bank operations |

## Regulation and Infrastructure

### Regulatory Structure

Capital markets regulation in the United States is fragmented across multiple agencies.

**Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** regulates securities markets, including stock exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and mutual funds. The SEC enforces securities laws, requires public disclosure, and pursues fraud.

**Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** regulates futures, options, and swap markets. The division between SEC (securities) and CFTC (commodities) dates to historical happenstance and creates occasional jurisdictional confusion (is a Bitcoin futures contract a security or a commodity?).

**Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)** is a self-regulatory organization that oversees broker-dealers. FINRA examines firms, enforces rules, and operates dispute resolution for investor complaints.

**Federal Reserve** oversees bank holding companies and has expanded its supervision of capital markets activities post-2008.

**Office of Financial Research (OFR)**, created by Dodd-Frank, monitors systemic risk and produces data and analysis.

### Market Infrastructure

The plumbing of capital markets—clearinghouses, depositories, payment systems—is invisible but essential.

**Clearinghouses** stand between buyers and sellers, guaranteeing trade settlement and reducing counterparty risk. If one party fails, the clearinghouse absorbs the loss (up to its resources). DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) clears and settles most U.S. equity and bond trades. OCC (Options Clearing Corporation) clears equity options. CME Clearing handles futures.

**Settlement cycles** have shortened to reduce risk. The U.S. moved to **T+1 settlement** (trade date plus one business day) in May 2024—down from T+2, itself reduced from T+3 in 2017. Faster settlement reduces the time during which counterparty risk exists.

**Depositories** hold securities electronically. DTCC's Depository Trust Company (DTC) holds virtually all U.S. stock and bond certificates in "street name." Transfers between brokers simply update DTC's records rather than moving physical certificates.

**Securities lending** allows owners to lend shares to short-sellers in exchange for fees. Short selling—betting that a stock price will fall by borrowing shares, selling them, and repurchasing later at (hopefully) a lower price—requires borrowing shares from current owners. Banks and custodians run securities lending programs for their clients.

**Trade reporting** has expanded post-2008. TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) publishes bond trade prices. Swap data repositories collect derivatives information.

## Recent Trends

### The Passive Investing Revolution

Index funds and ETFs have captured an ever-larger share of equity assets. Roughly 50% of U.S. equity mutual fund and ETF assets now track indices, up from 20% in 2010.

The implications are profound:
- **Fee compression**: Average equity fund fees have fallen from 1%+ to 0.5% as money flows to low-cost index funds
- **Index concentration**: Massive inflows to S&P 500 funds concentrate ownership (the "Big Three"—BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street—hold 20%+ of major companies)
- **Common ownership**: The same institutions own large stakes in competing firms, raising antitrust concerns
- **Price discovery**: If fewer investors actively analyze stocks, do prices still reflect information efficiently?

### Private Market Expansion

Private markets have grown faster than public markets. The number of U.S. public companies has declined from 8,000 in 1996 to roughly 4,400 today, while private equity-backed companies have multiplied.

Companies stay private longer, completing more funding rounds before going public. When they do IPO, valuations are often in the tens of billions. This means retail investors can access companies only after much of the growth has occurred.

"Private credit"—direct lending by non-bank investors—has grown from nearly nothing to a $1.7 trillion market as banks retreated post-2008 and PE firms created credit affiliates.

### The Retail Trading Renaissance

The pandemic triggered a surge in retail stock trading, enabled by commission-free brokerages and social media coordination.

The **"meme stock" phenomenon** of January 2021 exemplified this shift. Retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum coordinated purchases of GameStop (GME), a struggling video game retailer whose stock was heavily shorted by hedge funds. GameStop's share price rose from $17 to $483 in two weeks, inflicting billions in losses on short-sellers and forcing several hedge funds into distressed positions. Similar dynamics affected AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and other heavily-shorted stocks.

The episode raised fundamental questions about market structure:

- **Democratization or manipulation?** Retail traders argued they were beating hedge funds at their own game; critics saw potential market manipulation through coordinated buying
- **Payment for order flow**: Robinhood's temporary halt on GameStop purchases during the frenzy (due to clearinghouse capital requirements) fueled accusations that brokers protected institutional clients over retail
- **Short selling disclosure**: The episode exposed how little is known publicly about short positions

The SEC ultimately proposed but did not implement PFOF restrictions, instead requiring enhanced disclosure. Retail trading volumes have moderated from 2021 peaks but remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, with options trading particularly popular among individual investors.

### Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets

Cryptocurrency markets have developed alongside traditional capital markets, though with more volatility and less regulation.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap (roughly $800 billion), trades on crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken) and, since January 2024, through SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum (roughly $280 billion) is the second-largest.

The SEC has aggressively pursued crypto platforms for alleged securities law violations, while the industry argues most tokens aren't securities. Resolution remains pending in courts and Congress.

**Stablecoins**—cryptocurrencies pegged to the dollar—have become important for crypto trading (Tether, USDC) but raise monetary policy questions about private money creation.

### AI and Market Structure

Machine learning increasingly drives trading strategies, risk management, and research. Natural language processing analyzes earnings calls, news, and social media for trading signals. Quantitative hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies, Two Sigma, and D.E. Shaw deploy sophisticated ML models.

Concerns about AI in markets include:
- **Herding**: If models reach similar conclusions, correlated trading could amplify volatility
- **Opacity**: Complex models may create risks that humans don't understand
- **Speed**: Faster-than-human reaction could disadvantage traditional investors

## Firm Profiles

### NYSE (Intercontinental Exchange)

The New York Stock Exchange traces its origins to the Buttonwood Agreement of 1792, when 24 brokers agreed to trade securities under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street. For two centuries, NYSE was a member-owned cooperative, with "seats" (memberships) trading for as much as $4 million.

The exchange demutualized (converted from cooperative to corporation) in 2006 and merged with Archipelago, an electronic exchange. After a brief combination with Euronext (European exchanges), NYSE was acquired by Intercontinental Exchange in 2013.

ICE, founded in 2000 as an electronic energy trading platform, has grown through acquisitions into a diversified exchange and data company. Beyond NYSE, ICE operates commodity futures exchanges, mortgage technology platforms (including Ellie Mae), and a substantial fixed income data business.

Today, NYSE lists roughly 2,400 companies with combined market capitalization exceeding $28 trillion. The iconic trading floor at 11 Wall Street employs roughly 300 people—down from 1,500 in the 1990s—but remains symbolically important for IPOs, media appearances, and the opening/closing bells.

**Key statistics (2023):**
- ICE revenue: $8 billion
- NYSE listed companies: 2,400
- Average daily equity volume: 4 billion shares
- IPO proceeds: $15 billion
- Employees (ICE total): 12,000

### CME Group

CME Group is the world's largest derivatives exchange, formed through the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade. Subsequent acquisitions added NYMEX (energy), COMEX (metals), and other exchanges.

The company traces to the founding of the Chicago Board of Trade in 1848 to standardize grain trading. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, established in 1898 as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, pioneered financial futures in the 1970s—currency futures (1972), Treasury futures (1976), stock index futures (1982).

Today, CME Group trades roughly 6 billion contracts annually, including:
- Interest rate futures (SOFR, Treasury)
- Equity index futures (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow)
- Energy (crude oil, natural gas)
- Agricultural (corn, wheat, soybeans, cattle)
- Metals (gold, silver, copper)
- Foreign exchange

The E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is arguably the world's most important derivative, used for hedging, speculation, and portfolio management. Its overnight movements indicate how U.S. markets will open.

**Key statistics (2023):**
- Revenue: $5.5 billion
- Average daily volume: 24 million contracts
- Open interest: 120 million contracts
- Clearing members: 55
- Employees: 4,500

### Sequoia Capital

Sequoia Capital, founded in 1972 by Don Valentine, is arguably the most successful venture capital firm in history. Valentine, a former Fairchild Semiconductor sales manager, raised Sequoia's first fund of $3 million.

Early investments included Apple (1978), Cisco (1987), and Oracle (1986). More recent successes include Google (1999), YouTube (2005), LinkedIn (2003), Airbnb (2009), and Stripe (2011). The firm's cumulative return statistics are closely guarded but legendary—a $6 million investment in WhatsApp returned $3 billion when Facebook acquired it.

Sequoia's model emphasizes long-term relationships with founders and "company building" beyond capital. Partners often take board seats and provide operational guidance. The firm tends toward growth and technology investments, with particular strength in enterprise software and consumer internet.

Unlike most VC firms that return capital to investors after each fund, Sequoia in 2021 restructured to hold investments indefinitely through a permanent structure—a recognition that the best companies may never need to exit.

**Key statistics:**
- AUM: roughly $85 billion
- Active portfolio companies: 300+
- IPOs/acquisitions: 400+
- Locations: Menlo Park, London, India, China, Southeast Asia
- Partners: roughly 60

## Firm Profile: Vanguard Group

> **Quick Facts**
> - **Headquarters:** Malvern, Pennsylvania
> - **Assets Under Management:** $9.3 trillion (2024)
> - **Structure:** Owned by its funds (and thus by fund shareholders)
> - **Employees:** 20,000+

Vanguard is the world's largest mutual fund company and the second-largest asset manager, having pioneered low-cost index investing and transformed how Americans save for retirement. The company's unique ownership structure—Vanguard is owned by its funds, which are owned by their shareholders—means profits flow back to investors through lower fees rather than to outside shareholders.

John Bogle founded Vanguard in 1975 after being fired from Wellington Management. His contrarian insight: most active managers fail to beat the market after fees, so investors are better served by low-cost funds that simply track market indices. The first retail index fund, tracking the S&P 500, launched in 1976 to industry ridicule ("Bogle's Folly"). Today that fund holds over $1 trillion.

Vanguard's relentless cost reduction has driven average expense ratios across the industry down from over 1% to around 0.5%. The company's largest funds charge just 0.03-0.04% annually—$3-4 per $10,000 invested. This compounding cost advantage has attracted enormous inflows: Vanguard grew from $1 trillion in 2008 to $9+ trillion today, largely through organic growth rather than acquisitions. Along with BlackRock and State Street, Vanguard forms the "Big Three" passive managers whose combined holdings make them top shareholders in most large American companies—a concentration that raises questions about market competition, corporate governance, and index investing's effects on price discovery.

## Conclusion

American capital markets are the world's largest and most sophisticated, channeling trillions of dollars from savers to borrowers and from passive investors to active managers. Their depth and liquidity give U.S. companies access to capital that firms in other countries cannot match.

Yet capital markets also concentrate wealth and power. The three largest asset managers hold enormous stakes in most major corporations. Private equity firms control large swaths of the economy with minimal public disclosure. High-frequency traders profit from speed advantages unavailable to ordinary investors. The shift from public to private markets means growth increasingly occurs outside the reach of regular investors.

These markets are not self-regulating. The 2008 crisis demonstrated how interconnected markets can transmit and amplify shocks. Post-crisis regulation has reduced some risks while potentially creating new ones (concentration in clearinghouses, for example). The rise of crypto, AI trading, and private credit creates regulatory challenges that authorities are still working to address.

For the American economy, capital markets serve as the circulatory system—moving resources to their highest-valued uses, enabling risk sharing, and providing price signals that guide investment. How well they perform that function depends on market structure, regulation, and the incentives of participants.
