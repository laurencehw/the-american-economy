# The American Economy: A Structural Geography

## What This Book Is About

This book offers a concrete, institutional guide to how the American economy actually works. Not abstract theory, but the real ecosystem: which industries dominate, where they're located, who the major players are, how money flows, what the government does with 40% of GDP, how trade works with neighbors, what people buy, and how it all connects.

The United States has a $27 trillion economy---the largest in the world. But what does that actually mean? Where does the money come from and where does it go? Who works in what industries, and where? How do the pieces fit together?

These are surprisingly difficult questions to answer. Economics courses teach models and theory. Business schools focus on strategy and finance from the firm's perspective. Neither provides a systematic map of the economic terrain---the kind of concrete knowledge that a regional planner, a journalist covering business, or an informed citizen might want.

This book attempts to fill that gap. It draws on the tradition of regional economics, institutional economics, and economic geography to provide a structural portrait of the American economy as it exists today.

## What You'll Find Here

**Part I** establishes the framework: how we measure the economy, how different sectors connect through input-output relationships, and how economic activity is distributed geographically.

**Part II** examines the major sectors of the economy---from government (the largest) through healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, technology, energy, and more. Each chapter follows a consistent template: size and scope, how the industry actually works, who the major players are, where it's concentrated geographically, how it's regulated, and who lobbies for it.

**Part III** dives deeper into the financial architecture: how the banking system works, how capital markets function, and how companies are actually financed.

**Part IV** covers America's trading relationships and global supply chains, with particular attention to the integrated North American economy.

**Part V** offers regional portraits: the Northeast corridor, the Sunbelt, the Midwest, the West, and rural America.

**Part VI** examines the institutional landscape: federal economic governance, trade associations and business lobbying, and labor organizations.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for a mixed audience:

- **General readers** who want to understand how the economy actually works
- **Undergraduate students** in economics, public policy, or business who need institutional context
- **Graduate students and researchers** who need a reference on industry structure
- **Journalists and policy professionals** who need background on specific sectors

The main text is accessible and avoids unnecessary jargon. Technical details and data methods are relegated to appendices for those who want to dig deeper.

## A Note on Data

The primary reference year for data in this book is 2022-2023. Economic statistics come from official sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for GDP and industry accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for employment, the Census Bureau for business establishments, and various regulatory agencies for sector-specific data.

Where possible, I've tried to use the most recent available data, but economic statistics are often released with a lag. The goal is to capture the structure of the economy as it exists in the 2020s, not to provide a real-time snapshot.
